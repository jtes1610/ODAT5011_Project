For this is an impressive, dense and seriously age-worthy Port. While it has plenty of perfumed jammy red fruits and balanced acidity, it is the dark tannic character that will sustain this wine for decades. It could be drunk now for its fruit, although that would be a shame. Better to wait until 2030 and longer."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,13,"The initial shock is of intense acidity. Only after a while, do the structure and the fruit show. It makes this an unbalanced wine, the structure out of kilter with the fruit."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,84,13,"A tropical fruit flavored wine with yellow fruits, pineapple and mango. It is soft and very ripe although still showing some of the fresher acidity that should be in an Alvarinho wine. It's a long way from the cool north of Portugal."

It comes from a year that was not generally declared as a vintage."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,95,80,"This is a field blend from the steep Quinta da Foz vineyard at the mouth of the Pinhão River.

It will age well, don't drink before 2019."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,95,100,"A hugely structured and powerful wine, this wine comes from old vines at Herdade do Espoão's Douro vineyard.

Portugal,Port,Red,95,320,"Old gold in color, this is a really mature Colheita from a great vintage Port year. It shows a firm structure that brings out its dry character along with its dense mature flavors, its spicy wood and its great concentration. As it develops in the glass, rich fruitiness comes through to add to the old wood flavors. This is a wine to savor slowly, a real meditation wine that demands attention."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,95,40,"Produced from grapes grown on granite soil, this expresses the extremes of the Douro that produce the finest wines.

Portugal,Port,Red,94,100,"Not one of the generally declared vintages for Port, this year produced some ripe, sweet single quinta vintages. It also was a good year for rich, sweet tawnies. This is ripe, toffee-like in character packed with ripe raisin and sultana flavors. It is a luxurious wine, of course ready to drink."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,110,"Made from a field blend of old vines to which some Tinta Roriz added, this powerful, ripe and fruity wine is both concentrated and superbly generous. It has swathes of black fruits, dark tannins and minerality, all striated with acidity and a firm black plum skin texture. This is a wine to age, drink from 2019."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,12,"With some earthy, rustic flavors the wine seems to have missed out on some of its fruit. It is more about structure and firm tannins with only hints of juicy fruit behind."

New wood comes through richly on this powerhouse of texture and density. Give the wine at least six years to mature.
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,40,"New wood aromas give this very fine wine a firm start in life. It also shows rich blackberry fruits, dark plums and a solid, tannic character. Dense and concentrated with a smooth surface hiding a much firmer core. A serious wine  needing aging."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,93,35,"Ikon refers to Touriga Nacional's position as Portugal's iconic grape. It is almost black in color, and profoundly dense and dry with wood tannins at this early stage of development. Yet it promises a palate that's rich and smooth with fruit in time. It's intended for long-term aging so drink from 2017."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,34,"From a great year in the Douro, this is a complex, impressive wine. It has elegance rather than brute power, pushed forward by smooth yet dry tannins and ripe black fruits. A touch of spice, balanced acidity and a great potential for aging. Drink from 2016."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,93,28,"This is a strong, firm wine with an initially earthy aroma that fills out with the scent of dark black fruits.

Langdon Shiverick, Comète Wines."

Drink this beautiful wine now."

Drink from late 2016 and until 2024."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,93,26,"Due to its location near the western end of the Douro vineyards, this vineyard makes very fine white wines.

Portugal,Port,Red,93,290,"This is a blend of five Colheita vintages, the oldest 1981, the youngest 1992.

The wood aging has left the wine rich and spicy with just a hint of dryness. Drink this wine now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,50,"Hugely dense and dark, this is a powerful and concentrated wine.

Drink this impressive wine from 2018."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,93,25,"This is an impressive wine. It's so balanced between opulent ripe fruit and a tight texture.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,110,"This is a hugely powerful and dense wine.

Drink this serious wine from 2018."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,30,"The rich fruit and tannins are immensely dense and concentrated. Black plums and the darkest structure give promise for long-term aging. Produced from a field blend of old vines, this is an impressive wine that speaks strongly of the schist soil and ripe grapes. Drink from 2020."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,45,"This is a rich, concentrated while also fruity wine.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,30,"Only produced in the best years, this is a finely made wine. It has ripe, concentrated fruits that are juicy when youthful and that will develop well.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,25,"This is a solid and dark wine, full of black fruits and dense tannins. It has weight and richness, as well as a leather and smoke character that comes from the wood aging. A powerful wine for aging, drink from 2017."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon,Red,92,15,"This dry, spicy, solidly tannic wine is still young. Its fruit, still hidden behind the structure, promises ripe plums and berries.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,35,"A structured, dense and concentrated wine, this has richness both in tannins and in fruit. It is a fine, rich, opulent wine that has weight as well as elegance. Delicate acidity cuts through the dark texture, sustained by berry fruits. Produced from old vines, the wine will age well. Drink from 2018."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,50,"This is a serious wine, dark with tannins and ripe with black fruits. It is structured, toasty, rich with its concentrated structure and juicy acidity. Dominated by Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon, the texture and density are still very present. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2018."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,770,"While this wine from a year that was not declared as a vintage, it has sweetness and ripe caramel and toffee character and it does, inevitably, show some age.

Drink this impressive wine now."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,85,"Dark gold in color, rich and on the dry side, this is a very fine wine from a family-owned quinta close to Régua. The long wood aging has introduced great concentration to the dried fruits and burnt toffee flavors. Marmalade and surprising freshness give the wine a lift. It is ready to drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,20,"The name of the wine comes from the huge horseshoe bend of the Douro River that surrounds the Meão vineyards on three sides. This is the second wine of the estate, ripe with tannins and packed with black fruits. It is developing quickly and is ready to drink now."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,47,"This year's dry conditions produced a fine crop of single quinta vintage Ports. That's perfect for the concentration in a Colheita tawny. This wine is rich, dense and with perfumed fruits that are still in evidence behind the old gold flavors of the wood aging. Drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,50,"Produced from four parcels of 100-year-old vines, this field blend wine is stylish and fruity while also being densely structured.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,55,"Situated at the mouth of the Pinhão River in the heart of the Douro vineyards, the steep slopes of this quinta are a prominent landmark. The wine is dark and dense, made to age with its firm tannins and concentrated black fruit flavors. Structured and still very firm, it will age well. Drink from 2018."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,25,"A field blend of grapes from old vines plus a year in wood have given this wine both structure and concentration.

It's a serious wine that needs to age. Drink from 2019."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,65,"Bulas wines come from vineyards in the heart of the Douro.

It's a sweeter style of tawny, rich with toffee and caramel flavors, just finished by acidity. Drink now."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,50,"This first aged tawny release from Wine & Soul is a dry wine that feels older than 10 years—the average age of its blend. Fine and rich, it's a serious blend with flavors of spice, raisins and prunes."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,91,18,"This 50-50 blend of Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional works surprisingly well. It has weight, but also a smooth texture and juicy swathes of black plum and red berry fruits. Juicy fruit flavors are encased in a firm, tannic shell that's solid and dark. The wine is drinkable now after decanting, but could benefit from aging until 2016."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,91,18,"This is a generous, opulent wine with spicy notes from wood aging complementing pear and ripe apple flavors. There is a sprinkle of lemon zest giving freshness to the rich texture. Full bodied but still well balanced, this is a wine to age. Drink from 2015."
Portugal,Chenin Blanc,White,91,19,"Winemaker Mario Pinheiro worked in South Africa and with the Chenin Blanc grape there. Bringing it to the Alentejo produces a surprisingly similar ripe, warm style of wine that's still fresh and citrusy while also having signs of bright pineapple and minerality. Drink from 2015."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,91,17,"This is an impressively rich wine, full of creamed apple and ripe apricot flavors. It has weight, a good amount of flesh, and acidity adding dimension to the concentration. It's great to drink now, but better to wait until 2014."

Portugal,Bastardo,Red,84,30,"A very light-colored wine, almost rosé, typical of the Bastardo grape, which has almost disappeared in the Douro. In that sense, this is a curiosity and the farmyard taste says much of why it is rarely found."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,86,14,"Plenty of fruit, right in your face with its very fresh character, sweetness, flavors of loganberries and a touch of spice."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,10,"In a delicious, fruity vein, here are red berry fruits, spiced with nutmeg and toast and given structure by juicy sweet tannins. Drink now."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,13,"A lean style bringing out acidity from the juicy black currant fruits. It has definite tannins supporting the fruit, while it finishes with fresh, perhaps too fresh, acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,58,"An impressively mature 20-year old tawny, showing great layers of wood acidity, dark figs and well-integrated spirit. In the house style, it is not a big wine, more perfumed and delicate, and elegant."

Portugal,Port,Red,91,16,"Mature, definitely dry in character, with attractive wood acidity. Dark gold in color, it has just enough sweetness, but the style is certainly a sipping Port, not a mixer, giving an intriguing finishing austerity."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,125,"Toffee and vanilla aromas give an intensely sweet, molasses and caramel flavored wine in an almost syrup-like consistency. It is very ripe, with some honey, balanced with a surprisingly fresh citrus character."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,9,"Soft, smoothly textured wine, its licorice and wood flavors balanced with blackberry juice fruits. It is fresh, full in the mouth, finishing with good acidity. Ready to drink."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,45,"This lushly fruity Port folds in enough intriguing floral aromas to be more than a simple fruit bomb. Briary notes add another element to the creamy boysenberry flavors that are incredibly rich but not cloying or syrupy. Likely to mature early but hold well, thanks to masses of supple tannins. Great quality for the price."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,43,"Starts off a bit floral and toasty, but the blueberry-scented fruit quickly asserts itself. Masses of soft, ripe fruit come through on the palate, along with a rich, dense, mouthfeel and soft but plentiful tannins."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,75,"Effectively a 25-year-old tawny, this wine starts off slowly, with restrained aromas of nuts and dried fruit. Then it caresses the palate with silky, lush, honeyed flavors of walnuts, oranges, cinnamon and clove, building to a crescendo on the long, anise-tinged finish."
Portugal,Baga,Red,91,60,"Luis Pato's Bairradas used to be the standouts of the D.O. In a sense they still are, although he has chosen to label them with the regional denomination of Beiras in protest over restrictive practices. In this example, Pato has harnessed the rough tannins and brash acidity of Baga into a rich creamy wine filled with blackberries and anise. It's still tannic and crisp, but it just needs another 10 years in the cellar to become fully appreciable."
Portugal,Portuguese Sparkling,White,85,12,"Foamy and creamy in the mouth, this definitely moves into sweet melon, sweet cookies, yeast, but with enough acidity. It would work well with fresh fruits."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,14,"Named after the monastery of Farizoa in Alentejo, this is in a fresh, fruity style, packed with sweet damsons, some fresh acidity, but more in open, welcoming richness. For drinking over the next year."
Portugal,Portuguese Sparkling,White,85,12,"A soft style, with some sweetness, but plenty of freshness to give a great lift. The sweet apple flavors are edged with acidity, but the whole wine has a good feeling of warmth."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,91,50,"Nutty and caramelly, this is a great example of aged tawny. Roasted walnut aromas waft from the glass, followed by flavors reminiscent of maple syrup carried across the palate on creamy-soft waves of richness."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,70,"A lighter (though not to say light), more floral style of vintage Port, with ethereal aromatics buttressed by blackberries and caramel. Finishes with bright acids and supple tannins that make it almost drinkable already. Try in 2008 and beyond."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,56,"A brooding nose of sullen blackberries and earth presages a wine that shows wonderful balance between fruit, alcohol, acidity and tannin. It's not a huge, extracted Port, but one that carries itself with grace, finishing with good length and soft tannins. Drink 2010–2030."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,90,18,"Sappy and intense on the nose, with cherries, blackberries and toast. Although some tasters used to the lush midpalates of New World wines may find this a little lacking in that department, it comes across as smooth and supple, with finely etched fruit flavors elegantly framed by oak."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,35,"Portuguese-owned Port houses, such as Barros, have long made terrific tawnies. This version is smoky and minerally, with nuts and citrus peel. It's supple and not very sweet, with a freshness and vibrancy that belie its age. Peppery on the finish."

Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,8,"Just off dry, this is a bright and crisp wine that bounces round the palate. It is summer apéritif time with this vivid, pink grapefruit-flavored wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,37,"A reasonably good buy in vintage Port, Silval is something of a second label for Quinta do Noval. It's less concentrated and suppler in the mouth than its sister wine, but still boasts compelling floral aromas allied to prune, berry and chocolate flavors. Worth trying a bottle before 2010."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,45,"Intentionally made in a friendly, fruit-forward style, Vau doesn't disappoint in 2000. It delivers what we've come to expect from this relatively recent creation, lush blackberry and plum flavors backed by clove and spice. If you like your Ports young and fruity, try this one soon; its longevity is untested."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,90,19,"A selection of lots not deemed worthy of inclusion in this estate's flagship red, Meandro is nevertheless a fine wine and an even better value. Smoke and herbs add complexity to the blueberries and blackberries found on the nose, while the flavors combine lush fruit with intense notes of spice and anise. Drink now–2008."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,25,"Barros's tawnies are worth seeking out. This young example shows the house's signature smoky, nutty aromas but adds more fruity scents of raisins and prunes. Supple in the mouth, with a long, toffee-filled finish."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,90,23,"Toast and vanilla notes from oak barrels are layered over aromas of cured meat and blackberries. On the palate, it's lush but not overly weighty or rich, just nicely balanced. There's plenty of spicy oak, especially on the finish, but also the fruit to support it."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,54,"This young vintage Port is quite big, with plenty of lush fruit and some herb and spice notes. It's also on the dry side for vintage Port, and it lacks the hulking tannins you might expect. Surprisingly ready to drink, even at this age."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,45,"This 20-year-old shows some surprisingly youthful notes of red fruits along with layers of caramel, honey, maple syrup and walnuts. Nicely balanced, and it comes in half-bottles too—the perfect size for smaller gatherings."
Portugal,Port,Red,97,95,"Powerful and dense, this wine exudes the darkest of tannins as well as intense black fruit. Layers of richness and structure show in this Port's considerable ageability, while its acidity lends freshness. This is a wine that should be aged for 15 years or more."
Portugal,Port,Red,96,200,"Old-gold in color, this wine has concentrated flavors with an almost medicinal intensity. Old wood and acidity form a dominant element along with a note of orange peel. A memorable wine for savoring."
Portugal,Port,Red,95,90,"A powerful, almost black-colored Port. It has the richness of the vintage allied to ripe blackberry flavors, and a mineral, tannic structure. Its great fruit makes it almost drinkable now, but aging will add so many more dimensions."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,95,65,"Here is a powerful, dense wine, with modest alcohol— thanks to the Dão's mountain climate and granite soil.

Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,94,35,"A superb example of the quality of Touriga Nacional. This wine combines the richness of the hot Alentejo sun with the sophisticated structure of the grape. Big, juicy and richly fruity as well as perfumed and elegant. Age it for at least 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,54,"A big rich wine from a warm year. Its powerful, dense structure is dominated by wood aging and fine blackberry and plum fruits. There is concentration along with swathes of delicious fruit. Age it for 4–5 years."
Portugal,Port,Red,94,100,"Now that the color of this superb wine has gone to old gold, it has definitely become a gloriously mature Port. The color translates into sweetness, which is allied to acidity, richness and an immense intensity due to its long wood aging."
Portugal,Port,Red,94,80,"Gold in color, this is a wood-aged Port. Despite being 26 years old, it is still lively, almost fruity. The wood character does certainly show strongly, but so do the delicious caramel and toffee flavors, which are balanced by an intense acidity. Like all Colheitas, it is ready to drink."
Portugal,Syrah,Red,93,35,"Even the stain on the base of the cork reveals this wine's huge color. With its open richness and structure, it's comparable to a Rhône wine. Wood aging has lended notes of spice to go with the flavors of plum jelly and ripe, sweet fruit."

Portugal,Port,Red,93,90,"A very dry Port, the tannins concentrating the fruit into a tight, mineral ball. Even if the fruit is suppressed at this stage, it will show through in years to come, leaving a structured but rich wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,30,"Smooth and rich, its tannins are buried in the ripe, sumptuous fruit. It's packed with red-berry, wild-strawberry and raspberry flavors, along with intense and juicy acidity. The structure does have a dry edge that promises aging, although the wine is very ready to drink now."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,25,"Bottled in June 2009, nearly four years after harvest, this is a limited production wine. It has great structure, tannin and beautiful ripe fruits. With a perfumed black-currant character, it is ready to drink now, but its tannins suggest aging potential."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,45,"A structured, elegant and concentrated wine. It is dominated by tannins, by its mineral structure and its black currant fruit.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,60,"A big, black-colored wine, high on mint aromas, this is wonderfully chewy and concentrated. It revels in its smooth texture over a powerfully tannic character. Big, black, brooding fruits are complemented by superripe acidity, bitter chocolate and a firm aftertaste. Age for 4–5 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,67,"Dark in color, as befits a wine that was food trodden in open fermenters. To say it has a Port-like feel is to emphasize the wine's concentration, the mellifluous tannins and the powerful black fruits. It needs several years aging."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,10,"This smooth, full-bodied wine offers plum jam flavors, concentration, with hints of herbs, sweet berries, laced with acidity. From the Herdade das Servas vineyards near the marble quarries of Estremoz, this is worth aging for two years."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,26,"A linear, dry style of Port, structured and assured. It has richness, of course, with flavors of dried fruits, dark black cherries and acidity. Even though it is an LBV, it could certainly age for a few years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,41,"A very round wine that offers a luscious, lip-smacking experience of rich fruits, sweet berries and soft tannins. The wine certainly has power, but even as a Grande Reserva, is unlikely to age. At the end, it is showy, not complex."
Portugal,Aragonês,Red,89,20,"Rich and soft, very smooth, this Alentejo version of Tinta Roriz in the Douro is ripe, rounded, full. It has tannins, although these integrate well with the rounded texture. There is a sense of power, but not overwhelming."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,85,13,"This is a crisp, fresh and fruity rosé, made from Touriga Nacional in the same region where Vinho Verde is produced. It's vivid acidity is bright, with raspberry flavors and low alcohol."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,85,12,"Earthy aromas lead to a wine that is closed, tight and very firm. It has tough tannins that mask the jellied red-fruit flavors, but should soften in a year, revealing a more juicy character."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,8,"A big-hearted wine, despite its modest alcohol. This character comes from the bold fruitiness—blackberry and sweet plum flavors—underpinned with acidity and a light touch of tannins. Ready to drink."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,13,"A densely tannic wine, chocolate and bitter coffee layered with dark fruit and a ripe, spicy edge. Pepper comes from the alcohol, but this is still a richly juicy wine, full of fruit, finishing with acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,11,"Bright and fresh Vinho Verde, with attractive citrus character and a light fizz over dryness. The wine is just right for summer drinking. Screwcap."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,6,"Crisp apple-green wine with just the right amount of acidity to balance the palate prickle. The wine is dry, laced with citrus."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,13,"While this is lightweight for a Douro wine, it does have a backbone of tannin. It is warm, with its damson jelly flavors giving a reassuring winter feel. The texture shows dusty tannins and a final juicy character. Screwcap."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,8,"Storks have traditionally nested in the tall chimnies of DFJ's winery, and this wine celebrates that. Soft, ripe and easily fruity, it has a light tannic touch, followed by some bright acidity and red-berry flavors. Screwcap."

Portugal,Alicante Bouschet,Red,88,40,"Hugely black in color, a big-hearted wine that tames the rustic Alicante Bouschet character to produce a densely tannic, spice and damson fruit driven wine. There is perhaps just a touch too much extraction, but there is no question about the force of the wine."
Portugal,Loureiro,White,84,9,"With its roundness, this wine shows the character of the Loureiro grape. Giving a tweak to the softer element is a burst of fine acidity, a lime juice note and a fresh aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,7,"Smooth and rounded with light, perfumed sweetness, this is an easy and approachable wine. Its pear and kiwi flavors come together easily. Screwcap."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,9,"A bright and fruity wine that has plenty of acidity, but a slightly distracting tomato flavor. It's slightly unbalanced as the fruit is too juicy for the rest of the wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,8,"A very dry wine, firmly tannic and feeling overextracted. It is hard and unlikely to yield much fruit."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,82,24,"A perfumed wine with wood aging flavors over citrus. From the Vinho Verde region, it's a curious hybrid of a wine, neither crisp enough nor rich enough."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,80,8,Aromas of strawberry sherbet are followed by sweet candy-shop flavors on the palate. Chill it thoroughly before drinking. Screwcap.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,12,"A strong, concentrated and ultimately rustic wine, a flavor that derives from the Alicante Bouschet in the blend. This gives it power and alcohol that shows in a pepper character. The final juicy palate feels solid and heavy."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,16,"A firmly tannic wine, with a woody core. It shows stalky black currant fruit along with tense acidity. At this stage, it is rough round the edges and could use  another year."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,24,"Lemon grass, lime and intensely crisp acidity identify the wine as definitely from the cool north of Portugal. A strong apple-skin texture dominates, leaving a wine that really needs shellfish type foods."
Portugal,Albana,White,87,11,"The leg here refers to the red-legged partridge which is native to southern Portugal. The wine is certainly red enough, a blend of Aragonês and Shiraz (they use the Australian spelling). It is firm, richly tannic, attractively full of rich berry, plum and spice."

A wine that deserves many years of aging."
Portugal,Port,Red,96,99,"Taylor Fladgate's vintage Ports are always among the legendary wines. This hugely structured wine keeps the dense, perfumed tradition very much alive. Along with the power, it also has wonderful fruit, bursting out with blackberry jam. Even with all the fruitiness, it needs to age for decades."
Portugal,Port,Red,95,99,"A classic Fonseca, rich and powerful, with just an extra edge of weight from the vintage. It has a dry character, a tannic edge that gives great promise, but the open-hearted fruit is all there. A wonderfully intense wine for aging."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,40,"Since we last reviewed a vintage of Romaneira, with the 2005 wine, the estate has moved closer to realizing its potential.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,90,"At this high alcohol, the wine should be bursting the envelope. Yet it still has great elegance, its richness rolling around the mouth.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,33,"A big, black-colored wine, impressively rich. Fermented in open stone lagars, it has an opulent ripe character, the black fruits sweet and generous. At the same time, the dense tannic structure promises good aging. Keep for 5–6 years or more."

Portugal,Port,Red,92,100,"Although 2008 was not a general vintage, some estates have released vintage Ports.

Portugal,Port,Red,89,25,"This is an LBV that could well age. Its tannins are still firm, although it does already have a delicious perfume of violets and rose hips, along with sweet black fruit. It will need decanting if drunk now."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,20,"For a wood-aged colheita, this is a young wine, the color still ruby and the raisins and sweet damson fruit still in evidence. The wood-aging comes through to give almond and coffee complexity."

Portugal,Port,Red,89,25,"Fourteen years in wood have given a wine that shows dried fruit, a definite old-toast character, along with nuts, licorice and intense acidity. The alcohol gives a burn to the wine and does hide some of the richness."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,90,"Both the high alcohol and the heavy bottle detract from what is a rich but balanced wine. It shows great concentration, dense texture, a powerful statement of the ripe fruit of the Alentejo. It's hard to seeing it aging much more than two years."

Portugal,Portuguese White,White,90,24,"The Bacalhôa quinta is more famed for its Cabernet-based red. Here Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc continue the Bordeaux connection. A superrich wine, although the creamy, full texture is beautifully balanced with a good layer of citrus. Full-bodied, stylish."
Portugal,Alfrocheiro,Red,90,13,"Powerful, concentrated wine, whose tannins fold well around the berry fruits, acidity and sweet plum juice flavors. It is solid and chunky, full of ripe flavors and bold acidity. Worth aging for 1–2 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,15,"Still young, this is a firmly tannic wine, its fruit under this dry surface. Give it a few months for the ripe blackcurrant and blackberry fruits to come forward. In two years, it will be a finely balanced wine."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,11,"Made from fruit that's sourced from the Buçaco Mountains in the east of Bairrada, this wine is rich and elegant, and its juicy fruit provides a counterbalance to the structure. With its youthful fruitiness, this is worth aging for another 2–3 years."

Portugal,Arinto,White,87,19,"While this is aged in barrel, the wood influence doesn't quite work for Arinto, which is a lively, fruity varietal.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,11,"Juicy and fruity, this black currant-flavored wine is supported by some dry tannins. It's a wine for the medium-term with its hints of wood and a touch of more bitter extraction at the end."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,15,"Very jammy, it has gentle, soft tannins, and strawberry fruits. It's fresh without any structure."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,85,9,"Fresh and fruity, this is a crisply made, drink-it-now rosé. With freshly crushed raspberries and light acidity, it's perfect for an apéritif."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,17,"Rich and full-bodied, this white has almond, peach and mango flavors. In the mouth, it feels rich and concentrated, the acidity slow to reveal itself."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,9,"Light, fresh and crisp, typical of bright cool whites of the Lisbon region. It has lively, fresh acidity, picked out with lemon and grapefruit flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,19,"Fresh berry fruits, with stalky tannins and a fine juicy acidity give an easy, soft and ripe wine. Short wood aging has softened the bursting fruit and added a light touch of spice."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,13,"Smoky, meaty aromas, with bacon flavors, bitter coffee and spice. It is rustic, its texture ragged around the edge. A wine that demands spicy barbecue food."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,9,"Soft wine, with simple pear and white currant fruit flavors. It tastes flat, one-dimensional, the acidity muted."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,14,"A typically fruity wine with a light prickle on the tongue and the crispest citrus flavors. The wine is light, bright, very clean and fragrant. Ready to drink."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,85,10,"Textured and mineral, this crisp wine has some lively acidity as well as raspberry fruitiness. It's totally ready for the summer."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,11,"Surprisingly soft, it has a warm, rich feel and only light acidity. It is rounded, with flavors of pink grapefruits and green plums, and is ready to drink."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,85,11,"Soft and fruity, this is a ripe style of rosé. It's dry and peppery, with fresh acidity cutting through its rounded texture. It's a rosé for food, with a full aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,9,"Lightly sweet, this is a refreshing, fruity wine. It's a great apéritif for the summer with its ripe lemon and grapefruit that are given a push by the softer green plum  fruits. Drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,9,"The wine displays plenty of the warmth of Alentejo while keeping a streak of fresh black currant fruitiness. It's soft, generous and ready to drink."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon,Red,84,9,"With a strongly juicy character and high acidity, this wine brings out the tannic character of the two grapes in the blend rather than the fruit. There's a spicy character and red fruit acidity at the end."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,84,8,"Not just named on a whim, some of the proceeds for the sale of this wine goes to protecting Asian elephants. Designed to pair with spicy food, this is a soft, very fruity wine. It is dry and spicy itself with just enough acidity to keep it fresh."
Portugal,Loureiro,White,84,13,A tight and textured wine that has layers of citrus as well as fresh apples. A bitter edge of sulphur spoils this otherwise lightly fruity wine.
Portugal,Rosé,Red,84,8,"This fresh and clean wine really delivers on fruitiness and a fresh acidity. It is a lightly sweetened wine, a summer apéritif."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,35,"Deeply fruity wine, almost black in color and very aromatic. It has opulent sweet ripe fruit, quite soft in character with violet and sweet plum flavors. It is probably not for long-term aging, while its fruit character will make it delicious soon."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,11,"A rounded wine, keeping the white fruit character of pears, given vibrancy by a citric grapefruit flavor. Full in the mouth, it has a smooth texture, finishing softly."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,10,"Spicy wine, with Moscatel giving an attractive lychee edge to the fresh apple skins and citrus. Lively final acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,11,"A soft, juicy wine, one-dimensional but attractive in its strawberry fruits. There are pleasant tannins to give just enough weight."
Portugal,Castelão,Red,85,8,"Attractive spicy wine from Setúbal region's signature grape. Ginger, berries and light wood work well together to give richness without weight."
Portugal,Bastardo,Red,84,30,"A very light-colored wine, almost rosé, typical of the Bastardo grape, which has almost disappeared in the Douro. In that sense, this is a curiosity and the farmyard taste says much of why it is rarely found."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,11,"A soft and fruity wine that has fresh acidity and a light lemon touch. The wine is broad, neutral in character and ready to drink."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,13,"This big, spicy wine is dominated by licorice and heavy toast wood flavors. It is rich and full of black plum skins with only a hint of acidity. The aftertaste is sharp and bitter."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,10,"The natural earthiness of Castelão shows through this soft and ripe blended wine. It's smoothly textured and juicy, although that barnyard feel doesn't quite go away. Drink now for its fresh acidity and easy fruit."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,8,"An attractively fruity wine that's easy to drink and fresh. Lemon and apples give a crisp edge, followed by a zesty, fragrant character. Drink this light wine now."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,9,"Lightly spicy, this is a soft, off-dry wine. Fresh citrus and apple fruit flavors are perfumed and fruity in the mouth. Not for any aging, it's already a rounded, soft, still fruity wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,21,"A dry wine, the sweetness overtaken by tannins, black currant stalkiness and acidity. It works well as a more serious style of Reserve Port, hinting at aging potential."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,21,"Structured wine, very perfumed, the aromas reflecting the delicious mix of black cherry, damson and spice flavors. The wine then shows strong tannins and a firm texture."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,10,"Earthy, spicy aromas are followed by a chunky wine, tasting of tough clay and limestone soils. Dark black currant fruits and layers of acidity, give an austere final flavor."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,10,"Attractive fruits with a good, juicy flavor characterize this easy, fresh wine. Black berry flavors and vivid acidity make it ready to drink now."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,12,"A sweet style of white Port, its nut and honey flavors dominant. It has good balance though, a delicious apéritif wine."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,85,10,"The Vinho Verde rosé style takes advantage of the high acidity of the red grapes in the region. Casa do Valle's rosé is bone dry, with an intense level of acidity, raspberry juice, crisp and fresh."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,85,7,"Fresh and fruity, with attractive pink coloring, this light rosé has raspberry flavors, a touch of sweetness and caramel. It finishes bright and crisp."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,83,10,"A cherry-pink-colored wine, soft and full-bodied. Flavors are of wild strawberries, red cherry with a touch of pepper. The wine feels fat, missing acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,10,"Still very young, this wine is full of acidity, lemon flavors and with a candy shop character. The wine needs to time to settle down."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,9,"A light prickle adds to the fresh, citrus character. It is bright, although there is an unbalanced confected sweetness that is less attractive. Drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,11,A soft and easy white wine that has a lightly perfumed touch from the Moscatel in the blend. Acidity cuts the pear and peach flavors to give a fresh lift at the end.
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,84,22,"The wine is firm with acidity and spice in tandem. It has a juicy character, although the acidity seems unbalanced with the rest of the wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,10,"This is a young and fruity wine at this stage, full of bright berry fruits and soft tannins. A green, bell pepper flavor mars the aftertaste."
Portugal,Alicante Bouschet,Red,84,15,"Firm layers of wood give a hard initial impression. There are hints of fruit under this plank-like character, but it will need some time to balance out, if at all."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,13,This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Arinto is bright and herbaceous. There is also a more tropical character with pineapple and mango adding their riper notes. The end has a mineral edge. The wine will improve by holding until 2015 in bottle.
Portugal,Sparkling Blend,White,89,40,"Soft, sweet, smooth wine. Its age shows in a nutty character that boosts the attractive mature acidity. It is ripe, full in the mouth, well balanced for drinking with food."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,14,"Spicy fresh berry fruit, with a great burst of ripe plum juice, along with acidity. This is rich, although easy and medium-bodied. Drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,14,"A wine that starts almost too soft, the structure only slowly coming through. The fruit is pleasant, wood and bitter chocolate, tobacco and spice, but the wine lacks definition."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,7,"A medium-dry Vinho Verde, this is light and fresh without being quite crisp enough. Well chilled, though, it makes a lively and fresh apéritif."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,22,"Tasting young, with a stalky edge, this reserve Port shows black fruits, very berry in character. It is structured, on the dry side."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,7,"Soft, light, flavored with raspberry and red fruit. There is a gentle tannin character to this open, fresh wine."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,83,9,"This candied rosé is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Syrah. Full of soft red berry fruits with only light acidity, it is off-dry to taste. A touch of pepper at the end is less attractive."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,83,9,"The wine is hard with little sign of potential juicy fruit at this stage. There is a tarry, dry character, firm and not balanced."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,20,"Dusty tannins lie easily on this perfumed, smoky wine. It is balanced, its sweetness layered with some acidity. Rich and smooth, although also structured and very attractive."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,10,"A hearty, red-fruited wine with soft tannins, licorice and a fresh, juicy character. This is a soft wine, attractively balanced, the warm Alentejo sunshine filling the glass."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,11,"Soft and fresh, a wine with delicious acidity, almonds and pink grapefruit flavors. A mineral edge comes through to give a vibrant aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,7,"Fresh, herbal and stalky, a light-bodied red wine that has some well-balanced residual sugar to go with the red berry fruits. The soft texture masks the acidity. Screw cap."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,11,"A bizarre blend of the hybrid Negra Mole and Trincadeira. The is soft, rather heavy in texture, rich plum flavors, lacking acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,81,9,"Rustic wine, its fruit angular and its tannins cutting into the wine awkwardly. Final acidity gives more sharpness."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,83,9,A sweet wine that has a candy shop confected taste. It does have acidity along with a touch of citrus although the sherbet aftertaste is off-putting.
Portugal,Rosé,Red,83,9,"Vividly pink in color, this is a light and sweet wine. There is a sugary aftertaste followed by fresh, crisp acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,82,18,"The wine is rustic, full of barnyard flavors and tannins. The fruit doesn't come through at all."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,58,"A dry wine, firmly tannic, although also with acidity and black currant fruit. Spices and licorice add interest, while the tannins finish this attractive wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,18,"A warm-hearted wine with acidity balanced by blackberry and red fruits. The wine is soft, with some sweetness, although the tannins do give a drier aftertaste."
Portugal,Gewürztraminer-Riesling,White,82,28,"The wine has sweetness as well as a sugar-water character. It is fruity, but has a concocted, artificial aftertaste."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,81,11,"A fat, soft wine that isn't fresh enough. There are some sweet strawberry flavors, a touch of caramel and a metallic edge."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,20,"With black fruits, very ripe and sweet, this is a stylish LBV. It is on the fruity side, although with an added substructure of tannin. Soft, rounded and very ready to drink, finishing with perfumed swathes of fruit."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,16,"Ripe pear fruit flavors go with green plums in the wine that has acidity, but does seem just too hot and heavy."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,22,"Farmyard aromas follow through to a firmly dry, darkly tannic wine with bitter licorice flavors. It has spice from wood, but a rustic character dominates."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,9,"Attractive red fruits and a good juicy character alongside soft tannins. This is an easy wine, ready to drink now."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,83,18,"A fat, rich rosé, full of ripe berry fruits, caramel and spice. It misses out on freshness, and the alcohol does give a burn."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,16,"Soft, ripe wine with some attractive red berry fruits, touches of mint and leather tannic edge."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,13,"Curious stalky fruit aromas don't translate well in this rather lean wine. It has black currant fruits, light tannins, prominent acidity, but lacks balanced density."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,24,"A simple fruity wine, attractive all the way through, the berry flavors given balance with some tannins. The wine has structured currants and acidity to bring out extra character."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,19,"A wine that is structured, balanced with its acidity and sweet fruits. The character is very aromatic and textured, full of plum skins and bitter chocolate. The finish has more acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,30,"This quinta is in the Rio Torto Valley in the heart of the Port vineyards. The wine is rich, sweet fruited, ripe with jammy blackberries and great perfumes. Open, already drinkable in a fruity way, it is likely to age over the medium term."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,22,"A fruity wine, with a dry tannic edge that brings out a more black currant character. There is a good balance of acidity to go with the sweetness, and suggestions of bottle age to round the wine out."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,87,32,"Full in the mouth, with attractive acidity and some weight, this feels rich. There is an initial earthy character, but this blows away to leave a ripe, green plum- and strawberry-flavored wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,80,12,"Raw, rustic wine, its tannins hardened by excessive acidity. It just about works as a rough and ready red."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,18,"Although there is brandy spirit on the nose, the palate is much more balanced. The wine has a rich feel to it, very fruity forward and attractive. It shows a great jelly note on the finish."
Portugal,Pinot Noir,Red,87,50,"An earthy, racy wine, ripe with strawberries and also laced with acidity. It has some weight, softness, with a yeast character creeping in."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,22,"Dry in style, with a firm and tannic backbone. The wine also has acidity, giving it a stylish edge of dry, stalky fruit and raisins. The aftertaste is sweeter, softer."
Portugal,Portuguese Sparkling,White,86,25,"Crisp and dry, this is a taut, nervy sparkling wine. It has kiwi and lime flavors, along with yeast. The acidity is a major element in its tight texture."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,25,"Violets and aromatic herbs give character to the wine, while the palate is dry, with good tannins to go with the cherry and plum fruits. There is a good balance, the spice and chocolate richness adding interest."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,20,"Concentrated, perfumed with aromatic violets and red berries. The wine has a rich character, showing berry fruits and light tannins that offer a rounded style."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,125,"Dark raisin and dried apricot flavors manifest on this immensely dark, old goldhued wine. Enormous concentration, as with the initially, almost painful acidity that comes through the spirit. This is an old wine, no question, but not too old, one to be savored in sips with all the flavors working at high intensity."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,25,"A fruity Port, with plum and spice character, very jammy and sweet. Touches of tannin and acidity give balance to make the wine ripe, soft and full in the mouth."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,19,"Bright fruits in a Port with soft tannins and a structure that pushes blackberry fruit and sweet jelly. The wine is soft, ripe, full, showing some dryness from tannins on the finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,58,"An impressively mature 20-year old tawny, showing great layers of wood acidity, dark figs and well-integrated spirit. In the house style, it is not a big wine, more perfumed and delicate, and elegant."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,44,"An elegant tawny, perfumed with soft tannins and a good edge of wood acidity and spirit. The wine is dry, densely flavored, tasting mature, showing a good balance between young sweetness and age, with everything well integrated."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,16,"Mature, definitely dry in character, with attractive wood acidity. Dark gold in color, it has just enough sweetness, but the style is certainly a sipping Port, not a mixer, giving an intriguing finishing austerity."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,125,"Toffee and vanilla aromas give an intensely sweet, molasses and caramel flavored wine in an almost syrup-like consistency. It is very ripe, with some honey, balanced with a surprisingly fresh citrus character."
Portugal,Madeira Blend,Red,90,49,"The Madeira regulations say that 10-years old is the age of the youngest part of the blend. So this richly sweet Malmsey contains many older wines. These are shown in the old gold color, the proper citrus acidity and the dryness that goes with wood aging. At the end, though, the liquid honey flavors are dominant."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,20,"Richly fruity, quite sweet with red berry fruits and light acidity. There is a soft character and an attractive, easy finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,16,"Toffee, caramel and good maturity on this sophisticated wine. There is a spirit edge, but it works because the fruit is subservient to the maturity, ripeness and richness. The aftertaste is just perfumed."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,33,"Sandeman's single quinta vintage is based around Quinta do Vau. Made in a deliberately fruity style, it is full of blackberry fruit jam flavors, with fleshy plums. The tannins are low-key, just showing through as a core of dryness. This is not a long-term aging vintage—best in 5–10 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Sparkling,White,85,18,"A wine that is beginning to show its age, with yeast and toast dominating the fresh acidity and the broad, creamy character. It has a light texture, with a bite of steel to give the wine a final shape."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,53,"Sweet almonds and marzipan flavors go with some fresh acidity, soft raspberry jam fruits and a layer of mature sultanas. The overall effect is of a fresh wine, as well as dried fruits."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,20,"Great depth of flavor with fruit and a layer of mature almond nuttiness. The wine shows some wood, but also dried figs, prunes and some mature acidity. Not quite dry, but edging in that direction."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,28,"With its proper tawny red color, this is an attractively balanced 10-year old, with plenty of fresh fruits as well as wood and almonds. It's delicate, fruity and tastes even better lightly chilled."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional Blend,Red,87,11,"Fast becoming one of the hallmark blends of Portugal, this 50-50 mix of Aragonez and Touriga Nacional is a seriously structured wine, with great wild fruit and mushroom flavors alongside dark, dry tannins. The acidity is very definite. A good food wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,18,"Strong perfumed fruit aromas set the scene for a lavender-scented wine, with rich texture and dark tannins. It is relatively dry, the fruit character more of plum skins than of juice. Very stylish."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,10,"Fresh and perfumed, this wine offers great citric flavors, a lively crispness rare in white wines from central Portugal. Pear and some yellow fruits give roundness."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,16,"This sweetest of white Port categories delivers a ripe, rounded, opulent wine that  shows delicious fruit. It is very rich rather than over-sweet, although there is a definite toffee character."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,23,"A rich, intense wine, a definite step up from the standard Periquita, smooth and packed with sweet, ripe red fruits, the juiciness of the Castelão grape tamed by the wood polish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,60,"From old, mixed planting vineyards in the Quinta do Vallado, this is an impressively complex blend of flavors, from rich spice, smooth tannins, the richest plum juice and a gorgeous, opulent texture. It is ripe, drinkable now, but likely to benefit from several years aging."
Portugal,Port,Red,95,102,"Remarkably, this is able to show age and long cask aging, but the flavor is still here: figs and honey, balanced out with burnt caramel aged acidity and a rich (but not sweet) finish. Excellent, top quality aged tawny."
Portugal,Trincadeira,Red,87,14,"Fresh and fruity, this is a wine that's all about juicy textures, ripe fruit, touched by dry tannins. Flavors of tomatoes, red plums and a lively acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,7,"This is Casal Branco's branded wine, designed to be drunk young. And that's exactly how it tastes, with bright, lively fruit, soft tannins, a very light vegetal hint, and a soft, almost jammy aftertaste. Highly enjoyable."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,93,40,"A blend of Chardonnay and Maria Gomes, here is a ripe wood- and apricot-flavored wine. It is full, spicy, livened by crispness from a red apple skin texture. The vanilla from the wood adds a delicious richness to this impressive wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,50,"A step up from the Follies range, this is a big and richly smooth black wine, its tannins well integrated into the great plum juice fruits. The wine is ripe, now ready to drink, the final blackberry acidity giving a bright boost."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,115,"With its inky dark color, this is darkly dense, a huge mouthful of black fruits and dark, initially medicinal flavors and firm, concentrated tannins. It will age 20 years at least, but its sweet, ripe fruit suggest it could be drunk much earlier than that."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,26,"Traditional here means that this is bottled unfiltered, giving it a good aging ability. Bottled in 1999, this is smooth and velvety in texture, showing signs of maturity. It has many of the complex flavors of a vintage Port."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,10,"With what seems a stylistic change, this 2005 version of Periquita is firm, tannic, structured, with dark fruits and plenty of dry tannins. It is impressive for a big brand, dark and concentrated."
Portugal,Bical,White,86,15,"Rounded but also fruity, this soft wine is perfumed, hinting at white flowers and tropical fruits. While the acidity is low, the fruit is easy, ripe and lightly structured."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,17,"A wine that has some acidity, but also tastes somewhat hot. There is some spice from the wood aging, balancing the white plum and stone fruit flavors. What is missing is the acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,32,"A deliciously ripe wine, all structure, intense black plum fruits, and sweet licorice and tar flavors. Bringing all these great flavors together are the fresh edge, the tannins and the dense fruits."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,67,"A concentrated wine, still just beginning its journey. The fruits are packed into a firm and tannic structure that shows edges of wood. Berry and plum fruits dominate this powerful but well-balanced wine. Keep for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,50,"This looks and tastes young for its age, sweet and caramel in flavor, the wood element missing. It's almost syrupy in its texture, a full-bodied style, with fresh black fruits still there."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,10,"Soft and light, with good black plum and fig flavors. There's a touch of spice, but this is lively, juicy and fresh."
Portugal,Alicante Bouschet,Red,86,11,"It may be a second-rate grape in France, but in Portugal Alicante Bouschet has really come into its own. This is a ripe, smooth wine, with dark plum skin tannins, red peppers and intense concentrated spice. Drink now."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,70,"Always  great, this is softer, less intense than in the past. But there is still great richness, and power as well as smoothness, burnt caramel blending well with the spirit, and finishing with its inimitable fresh acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,45,"With its dark gold color, this fits the part of an aged, vintage-dated tawny even before tasting. It has great concentration, black raisin flavors, and hugely dense texture, leavened by an equally important layer of acidity. An impressive wine that leaves a very dry aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,20,"A big-hearted, fruity wine. With its ripe tannins and red berry fruits, this red is certainly powerful, but it manages to keep its balance, finishing ripe and sweet. This is a wine that could be enjoyed now, but would certainly age over the next 4–5 years."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,92,13,"Alvarinho is the grape of northern Vinho Verde, giving a style that is rich and complex. The fruit here fits that character, packed with pear, apple and citrus flavors and a light texture of lime zest. Note: this wine is commercialized as Follies Alvarinho outside the U.S."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,19,"Concentrated and dry, this shows good blackberry fruits to go along with the firm, dark tannins and ripe, juicy flavors. The fruit is rich, but not overtly sweet, more juiciness and acidity to go with the balancing spirit."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,16,"Relatively dry, this has some firm tannins, darkened by plum skin flavors and ripe berries, lifted with acidity. The spirit element comes through as pepper and spice, giving an edge to the soft fruit."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,135,"It has a medicinal character along with flavors of syrup and wood. It is concentrated, almost too concentrated, very intense, to be drunk by the drop rather than the glass."
Portugal,Castelão,Red,86,10,"Palmela is the region just south of Lisbon, producing light, fresh wines that are both great values and great everyday drinking. The strawberry fruit flavors are immediately appealing, freshened by the acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,10,"A ripe, soft wine that represents great drinking value. The fruit is fresh and easy, with light tannins and acidity. This is juicy, full of red fruits and touched by a light element of wood."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,85,11,"A soft, lightly sweet style of rosé, flavored with strawberries and a touch of caramel. Fresh, and flavorful, with balancing acidity, this is a good apéritif wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,22,"This is all about power and rich fruit. A great depth of flavor, dark and brooding, but also with great sweetness and richness. This is an outstanding powerful wine, which will age."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,130,"A golden, glowing wine, very concentrated. The burnt vanilla and dark chocolate flavors are intense. Like many 40-year olds, this has just a hint of a medicinal character, suggesting (rightly) that it should be sipped rather than drunk."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,28,"A fine, balanced wine that brings out good toastiness alongside sweet, ripe fruit. Well made, showing good balance, with acidity giving a lift to all the richness. The aftertaste is rounded and delicious."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,28,"A finely structured wine that relishes its blackberry jelly, new wood and dense, concentrated texture. The wine is powerful, firm, certainly rich, but with a sense of restraint that gives it elegance."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,25,"Still young, this is a complex wine. It has layers of dusty tannins, spiced fruits, ripe blackberries and a dark structure. Black chocolate and licorice feed extra richness into the wine. Very smooth aftertaste."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,92,18,"Continuing the succession of fine wines from Aveleda's Quinta da Agueira in Bairrada, this is a powerful, firmly tannic but ultimately smooth wine. It has big ripe swathes of dark plums, figs and refreshing sweet acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,35,"Keeping some freshness, but showing signs of dryness, this is a well-aged 10-year old, the wood acidity and spirit dominating the fruit. The aftertaste shows considerable age—more than 10 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,20,"A firm wine, with dark chocolate and coffee flavors. The fruit flavors are  dark fig and stewed plums; there is a bitter edge to the tannins."
Portugal,Alfrocheiro,Red,85,11,"Normally grown in the Dão region, this grape needs poor soil to flourish. On its own, it makes a powerfully fruity wine packed with red fruits and some flavors of dark chocolate. The acidity is intense, and needs another few months to settle down."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,9,"Crisp apples, touched with some sweetness, but finely clean and fresh, this is a great apéritif style of Vinho Verde, finishing with just a sparkle. Screwcap."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,23,"For freshness, it is worth buying this young LBV. It has all the structure needed, a dark chocolate undertone, but it is the fresh black fruits and the lift of acidity that make it so attractive."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,24,"An attractive, structured, balanced wine, showing floral aromas, deliciously rounded ripe fruit, held in check by fresh blackberry flavor. The richness is here, but it is subtle, giving a wine that is powerful but food friendly."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,21,"Taking the idea of its name from Sauternes producers, the second wine from Romaneira is rich, succulent and fruity. There are plenty of tannins, but they are soft, leaving the main flavors to black fruits, toast and spice."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,20,"A great structured, finely textured wine. The black tarry fruit, sweet licorice and black currant flavors all hang together well, leaving ripeness and feel of elegance."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon,Red,91,13,"From the aroma, this seems heavily wooded, but on the palate the wood spice is becoming well integrated with the dark berry fruits and mineral texture. It is certainly young. Already, though, the fruit is showing its potential richness. Give it 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,90,"From old vines, on pre-phylloxera terraces, this is a powerful, concentrated wine. It is solid, packed with sweet rich fruits with an opulent texture. The acidity keeps the extravagance in check, but this is not a faint-hearted wine."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,91,13,"A broad style of wine, bringing in the richness of Alvarinho and the more crisp character of Loureiro. It is very much in Vinho Verde style, just with extra power to give a final creamy character."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,15,"From pure Touriga Nacional, this is already mature, with earthy overtones coming through to give leather aromas and flavors that are moving into spice, sweet wood and dark coffee. It has a great smooth texture with delicious final acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,18,"Smooth-textured Port, with sweet red fruits under the brown sugar, nut and spirit flavors. This is certainly on the sweet side, with a velvet feel to it."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,12,"A full wine, balanced with an attractive citrus character and some creamy texture. There is also an edge of tannin that makes it a good, fresh, food wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,20,"A great LBV, intense and concentrated, with dark plum skin flavors, dried raisins and cocoa. This is very much a wine that is in the dry style of Dow's Ports."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,20,"Black and dense, with rich tannins, offering blackberry jelly, black plums and intense concentration. Initially, all this seems too much, but with its layer of fresh, juicy fruit the wine comes through well."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,23,"A heavy, powerful wine, with very concentrated tannins. Flavors of licorice, bitter chocolate and black plums give a sense of richness and opulence. Still young, the aromas are yeasty, but these should open up for a rich, dense wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,24,"Fresh, despite the dense tannin, this is a ripe, juicy wine, full of black currant flavors and vibrant acidity. Wood treatment shows more cassis just at the end to round the wine out."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,20,"A powerfully rich wine, packed with sweet plum juice and damson fruits. It has considerable density, its structure a firm edifice for the ripe fruits. Good aging potential here."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,16,"With plenty of weight, but weight that is concentrated around a tight, firm tannic core. The wine has great ripe plum and black cherry fruits, brimming from the glass. The acidity is a strong presence, and with the tannin promises several years' aging."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,35,"Broadened by spicy wood, this is a smooth, rich and opulent wine. It has sweet plum and black cherry flavors to go with its dense texture. There is a light sprinkling of pepper to go with the grated nutmeg and powerful core of tannins. For aging 5–6 years and more."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,32,"While it does have some proper nutty characteristics, this is very much in the fresh, fruity style of 10-year old tawny. The currant flavors are light, with only hints of spirit and with some dark plum fruits."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,15,"A medium-sweet, cinnamon-flavored wine, with some yeast, spice and fresh white fruit flavors. An attractive, simple wine to be drunk by itself."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,6,"A success in the sweeter Vinho Verde category. There is pleasant softness, flavors of green berries, grapefruit with sugar and freshness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,26,"The minerality that seems to come from this quinta makes for a wine that needs time, and this wine is defiantly young. However, its chocolate flavors, bitter toast and dense structure all promise well."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,29,"Fresh, jammy strawberry aromas, followed by a soft, balanced wine, with tannins and wood in fine harmony. It's ripe, packed with berry fruits, edged with dry tannins. The strawberry gives a fresh aftertaste."
Portugal,Petit Verdot,Red,91,44,"It is rare to find a pure Petit Verdot (the grape used in some blends in Bordeaux) anywhere, let alone in Portugal. The Alentejo is a good place, with guaranteed ripeness for this fickle grape. Dark in color, packed with dense tannins and a heavy layer of wood, this is not for the faint-hearted. It is certainly ripe and rich."
Portugal,Syrah,Red,90,24,"A firmly structured wine, its tannins well bedded into perfumed black plum fruits. It has juicy, fresh acidity over the rich fruits, giving brightness to an otherwise weighty wine."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,90,9,"Now in a smart clear blue bottle, this is Aveleda's estate wine. It is always a classic, with just some extra weight to give it distinction. The flavors are apple, brightened with lime, finishing with vibrant acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,35,"Smooth, wood and black fig flavored wine, rich and velvet in texture. The wine initially seems ready to drink, but then tannins kick in and it is obviously a wine with good aging potential. Certainly the weight, power and ripe fruit are all very evident."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,32,"A classic Portuguese blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Franca, this is a medium-bodied wine with good structure and presence of tannin. Bright fruit flavors of red currant, cherry and strawberry abound on the palate, finishing fresh and clean."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,25,"Very dark in color, this is an impressive wine with power and dense tannins. The fruit is solid, packed with blackberry and dark plum flavors, and wild, almost savage, ripeness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,30,"In the smooth, polished style of other wines in the Cistus range from Quinta de Val da Perdiz, this wine has mint aromas, licorice and some bitter chocolate flavors, rounded and burnished with new wood flavors. It needs aging—maybe 4 or 5 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,27,"Already a modern classic of the Douro, this red wine from Niepoort, with its baked apple and blackberry aromas, is intensely fruity and rounded with sweet wood, black plum and jelly flavors. The texture is smooth, soft, perhaps just missing a grip of tannin."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,48,"Impressively structured, packed with dark, heavy tannins, this is an aromatic Port. The initial black plum fruit and spice flavors are dominated by the structure, promising a good aging potential."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,24,"This is like a junior vintage. Because Niepoort bottles its LBVs unfiltered, they have ripeness and balance, while the fruit has great concentration of flavor. This is very rich with many black fruit and dark plum flavors, but at the same time it has a core of structure and tannin, which suggests that it could age. Bottled in 2006."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,58,"A great mouthful of sweet fruit, flavors of ripe figs and tannins are almost lost in this delicious wine. This is hardly a classic, long-term vintage, but it's almost ready to be a hugely enjoyable wine. For lovers of rich, almost sweet Zinfandel, go back to the original model with this wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,16,"With aromas of white currants and white figs, this Port has a strong, almond flavor with an edge of bitterness. There is considerable acidity, but the nuts tell the tale."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,24,"A big, dry brute of a wine, this is muscular and dense. Yet the fruit comes through well, not too jammy, offering some freshness and balance. The overall impression, though, is of power."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,20,"This grouping of top growers makes some of the best value wines from the Douro. Tres Bagos is their introductory bottling, a ripe, tarry firmly structured wine that is ready to drink, the juicy, black currant fruit delicious now."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,83,8,"An easy, fresh, slightly sparkling wine with pleasant, soft, lightly sweet fruit flavors. It is clean, a great apéritif for a summer's day."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,7,"On paper, this is an interesting blend of Aragonez and Cabernet; however, this fruity wine is much simpler than that. There is a spice element that adds some complexity, but the palate concentrates mainly on red fruits and layered acidity. Drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,12,"A soft, simple wine, the tannins set the pace, but the fruit doesn't quite follow. It is relatively light, with some red fruits and good acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,23,"Although with its vintage date, this is only 10 years' old, don't think of this as another 10-year-old aged tawny. Like most colheitas, aged in wood and not topped up with new wine as are aged tawnies, this is much more concentrated, like  syrup. It has some sweetness, but the dominant character is dark Belgian chocolate. Very dense, with a very dry aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,13,"Big and rich, this is a round and structured wine. It has great layers of ripe herbs, full black fruits and exotic spice to go over the dry tannins. The final flavors are rich, tarry, juicy as well as powerful."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,12,"Light, fresh, with some caramel and dried fruit flavors. This is a lightweight tawny, going more for freshness, with touches of raisins to finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,11,"Blackberry jam aromas, fresh, ripe jammy fruits, backed with sweet jelly and only lightly touched by spirit. A sweet, soft style, very easy."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,27,"Deep, dusty wine, tannins dominating the fruit, giving a tough feel. There are some black currant flavors, but only just a hint. This definitely needs time to soften and broaden; give it 4–5 years."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,70,"There is great balance between the ripeness, dark plum flavors and fine acidity. An intense wine, with easy tannins that are dusty, rather than dry."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,82,7,"Somewhat lean, this has a tart, grapefruit character that sits awkwardly with the otherwise fresh, green fruit character. Hard-edged."
Portugal,Castelão,Red,90,14,"Just turning in color, a wine that is beginning to mature. It has leathery texture over spice, ripe tannins and flavors of red fruit jelly. There is a bitter coffee character that melds easily into the tannins. It is a delicious wine, balanced and made for food."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,19,"This is a ruby reserve, bright red/black in color, with youthful fruity freshness. There are black fruits, with an edge of stalkiness, but ripely sweet at the same time. The aftertaste reveals good balancing acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,23,"This is a mature, deliciously perfumed and structured wine. There is a great milk chocolate flavor that balances the flavors of candied fruits."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,30,"Matured in new oak, this shows how the Douro is capable of great elegance. Flavors of dark fruits balance dry tannins and spice. This wine will age, for 10 years or more."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,71,"A great wine, which has the richness and the intense concentration of the Douro with a world-class style. This blend of Douro grapes is full of black fruits, of new wood flavors, of solid, dry tannins. But it also has tastes of prunes, of brooding dark fruits and balancing acidity. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest wines from the Douro."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,49,"The great estate of Vale de Meão, established in the 19th century by Dona Antonia Ferreira, is still in the family hands. It has produced this intense, fruit powered wine which packs herbs, dark tannins and sweet wood flavors. It oozes concentration from low yields and great ageability."
Portugal,Port,Red,82,20,"Attractive fresh apple aromas are then spoilt by a rather hard, tart character. The spirit is obvious here, giving an uncomfortable edge."
Portugal,Port,Red,82,23,"A curious aroma of honeysuckle and tomatoes spoils this wine. The texture itself is fine, but it seems to have unripe fruit, very dry and rather lean. It could age, but the starting point doesn't seem promising."
Portugal,Cabernet Sauvignon,Red,89,10,"The 15th century Quinta de Pancas, north of Lisbon, produces this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon wine. It has initially lean tannins, but the fruit has spice, black currant fruits and a tight line in wood and final sweetness. For aging."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,50,"Already throwing considerable sediment and possessed of a creamy, supple mouthfeel, this is a vintage Port that should probably be consumed young. Enjoy its lush blueberry fruit, chocolate and spice complexity over the next 10 years. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,60,"Still in the flush of youth, this creamy-textured vintage Port strikes all the right notes, from complex aromas to powerful flavors. Blackberry, plum and earth notes finish long, buttressed by supple tannins. Based on the rapid maturation of the 2001 and 2002, drink this one from 2010-2020."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,19,"Dry, firm and structured, with balancing acidity. Enjoy its solid tannins, spice and  dried fruits. Croft, now in the same group as Taylor Fladgate, is becoming a brand to buy again."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,14,"The high vineyards of inland eastern Portugal gives a wine that is initially austere, tasting very much of its rock terroir, cool and elegant. The fruit is very direct, fresh and juicy, with the tannins a strong presence. The final acidity is a cool burst."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,20,"A dry, powerful wine, almost austere initially, dominated by bitter chocolate and dried raisins. This is a great, firm, structured style."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,22,"Big and ripe, but also well structured, this is the style of LBV that could age in bottle. It has powerful black fruits, acidity and a dry core surrounded by the rich sweetness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,17,"A densely fruity wine, with berry and plum fruits, pushed by some firm tannins. It is the ripe fruit, brimming over the glass, that makes this wine so delicious and approachable now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,15,"Velvet-textured wine, smoothed by wood aging, the black fruits pushing through the layer of dusty tannins. It has a feeling of power and concentration. It could well age another 2–3 years or more. A step up over previous vintages."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,35,"Mature beyond its claimed 10 years, this is a wine that balances fine burnt and caramel flavors with some good fresh acidity. It's dry, showing some citrus as well as wood flavors, a perfumed wine and very elegant."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,21,"A firm, dry wine, very upright and elegant. It has power, but it's the initially austere perfumes that dominate. Dried currants go with black plum skins and definite tannins."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,88,60,"This is a big wine, going on sweet and superripe. It is almost heavy, the acidity a necessary foil to the dense matter here. Sweet and perfumed berry fruits are dominant along with spice from new wood."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,49,"A light, soft, sweet modern style of Port, flavored with raisins and some fresh acidity. There are stalky currant flavors, wood tannins, but the main emphasis is on an easy, soon to drink character."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,13,"Moscatel dominates the blend of this wine and gives a perfumed character. It has some good weight and freshness, a bright green plum and pear flavor. The acidity and ripe fruit are well in balance."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,22,"Already showing good balance between ripe wood and plum and blackberry fruits, this is a full wine. The acidity is a welcome layer of juicy freshness in the rich texture. Drink now and over the next 2–3 years."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,25,"Plummy on the nose, with the ripe aromas accented by hints of dried flowers. In the mouth, the texture is rich—almost syrupy—and the flavors head toward prune and chocolate fudge, finishing on drier, more complex notes of cocoa powder and spice. Imported by Kobrand."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,65,"Generally, 2004 is not a classic vintage Port year, but there are some very good ones around. This is soft, ripe and with good tannins. It will not age over many years, but its fresh red fruits and layer of dryness suggest it will be at its best in 3–4 years."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,21,"Sweet, fragrant, very luscious and soft. It is fruity and easy with some youthful freshness, and stalky, dried currant flavors. Certainly not intense, but immediately appealing."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,14,"There is an earthy aroma to this wine along with a rustic edge. There is also spice from minty wood, a dry core of tannins, with acidity that seems too prominent. All these characters suggest a wine that needs some aging over the next 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Sparkling,White,87,14,"Lovers of Moscato sparkling wines will enjoy this with its poise between sweetness and acidity. It is very fragrant, very refreshing, the sweetness never cloying."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,27,"Sweet with flavors of molasses and sweet chocolate, this is for lovers of a gentler side of Port. It is full, certainly, but it glides over the palate, easily and softly."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,12,"Crisp acidity and an attractive line in vivid citrus give a fresh, ready-to-drink wine. It has a bright pear juice final flavor."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,14,"The Symington family continues to make strides in their table wine production. This is a full-bodied, smooth-textured bistro-styled red that's more of a dark purple in hue, bringing blackberry, blueberry and spice and mineral notes to the table. Enjoy it over the next year or two for its exuberant fruit. Imported by Premium Port Wines, Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,20,"With its gorgeous scents of spice cake and dates, this is a seductive LBV from the very start. It's ripe and round in the mouth, soft and lush on the finish, with a cavalcade of fig, date, chocolate and dried-spice flavors. Drink now. Imported by Premium Port Wines, Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,70,"Floral and spicy on the nose, leading into ripe blackberry and blueberry flavors. Not the richest mouthfeel or deepest flavors, but a pretty Port that finishes with crisp acidity and firm tannins. Drink 2010–2020. Imported by Signature Imports."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,7,"This blend of Alfrochiero, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional is a steal at the $7 price. The meaty, peppery, blackberry nose and bouncy, medium-weight palate makes this wine a ringer for a good Côtes-du-Rhône, at a fraction of the price. Even shows good length on the peppery finish. Drink now–2008. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,23,"Ripe, soft and sweet, with easy acidity along with balanced tannins, fig flavors and a great lift of freshness to finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,17,"A pleasant, fresh wine with light raisin, spice and a warm rounded texture. Drink this easily, with pleasure."

Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,14,"A delicious citric-dominated wine, very fresh, with a great apple skin texture, bright aciidty and crisp white fruits. It dances easily, lightly, ready to drink now."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,19,"A very ripe style, with baked plum and prune aromas and flavors supported by hints of pastry crust and dried spices. Medium to full in body, with soft tannins and a long, spicy finish. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,12,"This is a bold, exuberantly fruity blend of 40% Touriga Franca, 40% Tinta Roriz and 20% Tinta Barroca. Mulberry and boysenberry flavors pick up hints of baked pie crust. A bit drying on the finish, but it also shows good depth of fruit. A new wine, with no track record for aging, so drink now and over the next few years. Imported by Premium Port Wines, Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,35,"Soft and very smooth, perfumed with rosehips and black figs. There's some burnt character, but more of the soft, sweet, treacly style of tawny."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,20,"Fresh and fruity, this is a prime example of good tawny. It has flavors of currants and figs, along with some wood acidity which gives it a great tawny character."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,48,"A surprisingly fresh wine for a 20-year-old, but there is still some good burnt toffee character, enlivened by fresh citrus and a firm, slightly austere base of wood and acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,7,"A richly fruity wine, packed with black plum juice and sustained on a firm bed of spicy wood. It is balanced, with attractive acidity and is certainly ready to drink."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,8,"Going for structure as much as fruit, this is a cool wine with black currant flavors giving high acidity. It feels light, fresh, although there are tannins and spice to give some final weight."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,88,14,"This dark purple wine opens with a trace of animale or game, but also boasts intense aromas and flavors of roasted blackberries, accented by pinches of cinnamon and clove. Broad in the mouth, it would be a solid choice to serve with grilled or roasted meats. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,25,"With its charming aromas of spice drop, ripe cherries and schistous minerality, this Taylor looks set to zoom. And it is tasty, but also a bit soft and lacking structure—something unexpected from a Port under the Taylor label. Turns chocolaty on the finish. Drink now. Imported by Kobrand."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,12,"A fresh-faced wine, bright with berry fruits, a light layer of tannins and a soft, easy texture. There is some stalkiness but this is great as a delicious, easy wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,13,"A lean style bringing out acidity from the juicy black currant fruits. It has definite tannins supporting the fruit, while it finishes with fresh, perhaps too fresh, acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,16,"This medium-bodied blend of Tinta Roriz, Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca boasts plenty of plump, juicy fruit backed by hints of cocoa and spice. The ripe cherry flavors are easy to enjoy, finishing on a fresh, mouthwatering note. Would be a great choice with grilled meats. Imported by Guardian of the Grape Imports."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,22,"This Reserva shows the beginnings of a tawny character while still keeping some of the freshness of young ruby. The color is beginning to go pale, the spirit is showing through, but the red fruits are still there."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,30,"Somewhat rustic on the nose, but the palate opens up with structured, ripe, dense tannins. It has a good backbone of freshness, finishing light and fruity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,9,"Soft, smoothly textured wine, its licorice and wood flavors balanced with blackberry juice fruits. It is fresh, full in the mouth, finishing with good acidity. Ready to drink."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,50,"Doesn't show the richness or complexity of its younger counterparts, but this effort from Ventozelo is still pretty good. Modest floral and chocolate notes and youthful grapy flavors hint at further aging potential, but the tannins are already soft. Better to err on the young side and drink it over the next several years. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,17,"A full and rich style, with sweetness and jammy red fruits lifted by a citrus touch. This is full-bodied, red currant cordial, very fruity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,10,"Bright citrus crispness on this young, lively wine. It has a creamy texture, pierced with fresh acidity, with extra weight from some peach juice flavors."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,20,"ripe, intense, dry fruit-flavored ruby Port that has depth of fruit and well-integrated spirit. A great, everyday drinking Port."
Portugal,Portuguese Sparkling,White,85,12,"Foamy and creamy in the mouth, this definitely moves into sweet melon, sweet cookies, yeast, but with enough acidity. It would work well with fresh fruits."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,14,"Named after the monastery of Farizoa in Alentejo, this is in a fresh, fruity style, packed with sweet damsons, some fresh acidity, but more in open, welcoming richness. For drinking over the next year."
Portugal,Portuguese Sparkling,White,85,12,"A soft style, with some sweetness, but plenty of freshness to give a great lift. The sweet apple flavors are edged with acidity, but the whole wine has a good feeling of warmth."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,30,"Shows a lifted fruit character on the nose—maybe even a little hint of nail polish—but also some earth and berry scents. Bright raspberry flavors on the palate are backed by mineral notes, finishing crisp. Lacks the weight and structure of the best vintage Ports. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,12,"A bit understated on the nose, but what's there is nice, offering modest cherry fruit alongside dried spices and cocoa. A bit creamy in the mouth, with smooth, supple tannins, and cherry and blackberry flavors that pick up pretty spice notes on the finish. Imported by Admiral Wine Imports."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,14,"The simplest of the Ferreira range of Ports, but still a bright fresh red fruit-flavored wine with a smooth texture. Good raisins and very soft tannins."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,18,"A raisin- and fresh fig-flavored wine, light and open. There's a hint of cocoa, acidity and some citrus."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,35,"This is too young to have the true taste of a vintage-dated Colheita. It is almost a young tawny, both in color and taste. As such, it is a pleasant wine, with good ripe, sweet fruits, sultanas. At the finish, the spirit is too dominant."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,14,"With its red gold color and fresh aromas, this is the youngest style of tawny Port. But in its class, it is smoothly made, a soft, ripe and sweet wine, just hinting at spirits."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,7,"Borges's simple red from the Douro emphasizes lightness and fruitiness. It is ready to drink with a fine, juicy character that brings out fresh blueberries and soft tannins, finished with acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Sparkling,White,85,12,"Fresh, with considerable acidity, this is as crisp as it gets. Apple and lemon juice dominate the flavors, with just a light touch of softness to calm the acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,8,"Just off dry, this is a bright and crisp wine that bounces round the palate. It is summer apéritif time with this vivid, pink grapefruit-flavored wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,15,"This Douro red speaks clearly of its origins, blending anise and mineral notes with ripe fruit. Resin and spice notes add interest to the black cherry flavors, backed by just a hint of toasty oak. Structured and firm, this wine could use a bit more lushness and flesh, but nicely conveys its sense of place. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,10,"Based on a core of dry tannins, this is a wine with some tough, stalky fruit along with black currant skin texture. It is firm, definitely for food, with those tannins that edge on bitter."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,84,5,"Bright, crisp raspberry flavors on a bone-dry wine. It is fresh and vibrant, a light touch of caramel and powerful acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,20,"Less lush and welcoming than the other LBVs reviewed for this issue, C. da Silva's Presidential brand instead shows more acidity and tannin. The result is a crisp, pepper- and plum-flavored Port with a slight rancio quality. Imported by Jack Poust & Co., Inc."
Portugal,Arinto,White,92,29,"An impressive white wine, made from the classy Arinto grape. The wine has been aged in wood, but the creamy toast blends easily with the rich white fruits. There is a Chardonnay-like richness here, a wine that is round, smooth, with just a final lift of acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,26,"A closed, dark, tight wine, with an austere, mineral character, that obviously needs considerable aging. Smoky, meaty, dark tannins are dominant here, the black berry fruit showing through the powerful structure. Keep for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,34,"A powerful expression of Touriga Nacional, from a single vineyard in the Dão revealing ripe structured fruits along with dark, linear tannins. The wine has spice, but the fruits are darkly dry, with a tense, firm aftertaste. Age for 2–3 years."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,92,36,"A serious, impressive wine, packed with the dark tannins of Touriga Nacional. It also has an elegance that gives it shape, structure and surprising poise for such a rich, juicy wine. The fruit is ripe, flavored with dark berries, cranberry tannins and some wood spice. Age for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,18,"Made from a collection of old varieties, with delicious ripe fruit, dark tannins and a powerful structure. The texture is surrounded by sweet fruit, super-rich plums, black figs, the exuberant fruit balanced by a more austere, serious side."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,32,"Many see the Touriga Nacional in the Dão as superior to the same grape in the Douro. As in this wine, it has power and richness, but with extra complexity, the fruit powered by dark tannins. The structure is solid, with a firm, spicy elegance."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,84,8,"Crushed strawberry aromas, followed by flavors that are fresh, sweet and a palate that has the delicious prickle of a young wine. Screwcap."
Portugal,Portuguese Rosé,Red,84,7,An attractive strawberry-flavored wine with light sweetness and a caramel edge. Acidity keeps it lively in a fine apéritif style.
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,8,"A fresh and light wine, this familiar Vinho Verde boasts simple citrus and pineapple flavors, bright and finally just off-dry. Great summer drinking."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,40,"An impressive wine that takes its name from the chalk and clay soils of the vineyards. It has acidity, sweet tarry characters, blackberries, cranberry juice and dense, dense tannins. The final burst of acidity sets the whole wine in context. Age for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,5,"They say red Vinho Verde is an acquired taste, and with its very tight tannins and acidity, this wine fits the billing. Think of it with sardines or fatty meats."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,45,"Garrafeira in Portugal means a special selection, and this wine, from low yielding vines, has an impressive concentration. Its dark chocolate and mature spice flavors are just part of a powerfully fruity wine, all dark plum skins and sweet acidity. Ready to drink now, but could age."
Portugal,Encruzado,White,90,12,"Made from the Dão's very own white grape, this wine shows a fine balance between creamy, ripe yellow fruits, spice and a tense mineral streak. The new wood flavors give the wine a great richness and lift, a final roundness over the fresh fruits."
Portugal,Arinto,White,90,18,"A barrel-aged white, with crisp acidity made rich by spice and toast. The balance is just right, the stone yellow fruits giving ripe softness, while minerality and acidity provide the contrast."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,83,13,"A dry rosé, dominated by caramel and raspberry fruit flavors. It has attractive acidity, but the texture does feel heavy, leaving a dull aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,83,5,"Dry Vinho Verde, showing all the citrus crispness that is the style's hallmark. It is light and fresh, demanding summer food, finishing with a brisk bite of acidity."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,90,16,"Coming from the Alvarinho region of Monção in the far north of Portugal, this is a rich wine, its creamy apple character brought out beautifully by its tight, steely edge. This has style, ripe fruit, a green plum skin edge to it, finished with vibrant acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,90,12,"A blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura, this is relatively full-bodied Vinho Verde. The creamy texture is the most apparent, always freshened with lively citric acidity, a very light prickle on the mouth. The wine is fragrant and crisp. Drink this summer, but also possible to age."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,6,"From a sun-baked region in the south, and this wine does show some of that heat in its slightly stewed fruit aromas and flavors. But there's also decent concentration, some pleasant strawberry and black pepper notes and a juicy, mouthwatering finish. Drink now. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,83,10,"Get past the pharmacy aromas and this is a pleasant, if rather fat, wine. It has some pear juice flavors along with a final light acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,15,"A blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz, with big, dusty tannins, ripe new wood and black, jammy fruit. The exuberance is held in check by minerality, but the final effect is of a ripe, satisfying wine, the spicy new wood showing strongly."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,19,"Escolha in Portuguese indicates an aged wine, and this solid, chunky red has obviously softened by wood and bottle aging. It has a velvet, warming texture, its black plum and berry fruits smoothing out the tannins. There is a great burst of juicy acidity to finish. Delicious to drink now, but worth aging."
Portugal,Alfrocheiro,Red,90,30,"There's plenty going on here, from the sweet tannins and strawberry flavors to the leathery, mature edge. The wine is so ripe, its structure keeping the generous fruit together, but allowing an almost opulent character to dominate."
Portugal,Tinta Roriz,Red,85,16,"A bit of a disappointment from this winery, but the flavors here seem a touch overripe, with pruny notes intruding into the blackberries. Obvious American oak marks the nose with herbal, dill-like notes and the finish with dry, woody tannins and caramel flavors. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,85,12,"An interesting wine—one that combines a certain sour, resinous quality with hints of sur-maturité. Add leather, clove and cinnamon and the result is a reasonably complex wine for a reasonable price. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,26,"A firmly dry wine, driven by the dark tannins, only opening slowly to give ripe berry fruits. The soft side of the wine does bring out the lighter nature of the Baga in the blend, which has been tamed by wood aging. There is a final flourish of fresh black plum juice."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,90,34,"Made jointly by Filipa Pato and her husband William, a blend of Encruzado from Dão and Bical from Bairrada, and cask fermented. It is a beautiful wine, dense, concentrated, rich and creamy, a mouthfilling wine with white figs, and a green plum skin texture."
Portugal,Shiraz,Red,90,11,"Its dark color promises power, and this wine delivers a broad, chunky Shiraz, with perfumed fruit, dark tannins and a spicy wood structure. Solid concentration gives a wine that somehow manages to assimilate a Franco/Australian variety into a dry Portuguese structure."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,29,"You want big, bold flavors, plenty of spicy wood? It's all here inside the heavyweight bottle. In fact, the spice is the most dominant character, flavors of grated nutmeg going right over the dark, closed tannins and big, brooding fruit. Give it 2–3 years."
Portugal,Encruzado,White,90,20,"The Dão's very own white variety, Encruzado gives a citric, bright lime and grapefruit wine, with a delicious bite of pear skin. This is a fine example of the grape, rounded at the edges, with an outburst of fresh acidity, very fresh, but worth aging for 2–3 years."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,84,7,"Slightly stewed or baked, but there's enough plum and herb complexity to keep it interesting. Soft and low in acid; supple and easy to drink over the next few months. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,10,"With its blend of Touriga Nacional, Castelão and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine successfully blends Portugal and France. There is already some maturity here, the wine soft, with red berries and a leather tannin character. Ready to drink now, with a final fresh acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,89,20,"A smooth, toasty wine, with distinct caramel and vanilla flavors, on top of ripe mangos and apricots. The Bical grape that dominates the blend gives a delicious creamy texture."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,17,"A blend of grapes from Filipa Pato's vineyards in Bairrada and Dão, very aromatic, with a smooth, silky texture. The wine shows ripeness, sweet berries and perfumed black currant, violets and licorice."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,89,11,"It is called Point West because Estremadura's vineyards are the furthest west in Europe. The wine itself is soft and fruity initially, but then there is a tight tannic texture, followed by black currant fruits. The wine is finely made, elegant, just on the warm side of cool."
Portugal,Castelão,Red,84,10,"Starts with pleasant notes of black cherries,  leather, and a hint of game, but also features a slightly drying, stalky note that shortens the finish. Tasted twice, with consistent notes. Imported by Signature Imports."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,24,"A smooth, well-integrated wine, showing sweet fruits, flavors of stewed red plums, with bright acidity. The proportions are all there, a wine that has style and freshness, as well as just the right fruit density."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,17,"This medium-bodied red features decent balance between tannins, alcohol and acids, but the flavors are just a little different. There are some cherry flavors, maybe even black cherry, but also herbal, chlorophyllic notes that start on the nose and persist through the finish. Imported by Carpathian Imports LLC."
Portugal,Arinto,White,89,19,"A fine, elegant wood-aged wine. It has ripe fruits, sweet peach, apricot, mango, while the vanilla of toast lifts all the flavors, adding spicy smoothness. Acidity comes from fresh lime. It could do with some aging, maybe 2–3 years."
Portugal,Pinot Noir,Red,89,25,"An exotic blend including Pinot Noir and Merlot along with Portuguese varieties, taking its name from two local villages with saint's names. It has acidity and an awkward bitter edge, with tough black fruits. Maybe it needs time for the wine to soften and meld with the tight acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,15,"A densely dry wine, the tannins dominating the fruit. In style, it harks back to the more tannic offerings from the Dão, but with a more modern interpretation that brings in berry fruits and a final fresh, juicy character."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,11,"An elegant style, the ripe fruit restrained and kept in check by the dry tannins and acidity. The flavors start lightly, but then the wine gives a fine intensity and concentration as it opens up. The berry flavors are balanced by the dried fruits, with a new wood layer coming through to finish. Worth aging for 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,17,"The main estate wine from Quinta dos Roques, this offers mature fruit, with acidity, layers of black figs, chocolate and licorice, as well as red plum juice. It is finely structured, giving some elegance to go with its complex flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,9,"The understated fruit in this light, lean wine has a character reminiscent of tart berries and sour cherries, framed by balsa wood. Turns lemony and dry on the finish. The crisp acids make it best with fatty meat dishes."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,11,"A bone-dry, slightly spritzy Vinho Verde, all sparkle and brightness. The crisp citrus and grapefruit character is fresh, vital and refreshing. This is what Vinho Verde is all about."
Portugal,Jaen,Red,88,26,"The Jaen, known in Bierzo, Spain as Mencia, gives freshly juicy wines, but with a definite edge of structure. This example has those characters, as well as concentration and ripeness. It is balanced, elegant, a great food wine."
Portugal,Baga,Red,88,11,"Bairrada's difficult grape, the Baga, needs time for aging, which is what has happened here. The result is a wine that is fragrant, not heavy, poised and fresh. The red berry fruits are lifted by acidity, there is a tell-tale Baga dry tannic core, but well in balance. A great food wine."
Portugal,Cabernet Sauvignon,Red,88,13,"A very Portuguese version of Cabernet Sauvignon, with sweet, jammy red berries and only light tannins. The fruit has freshness, but the dominant character is sweetness, ripeness, a wine full of final juicy acidity."
Portugal,Arinto,White,88,13,"Crisp, structured wine, showing the fruit skin and bite that makes Arinto such an interesting variety. There is an orange zest edge, emphasizing lightness, freshness, finishing a delicious wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,82,9,"Despite containing only a small percentage of Cabvernet Sauvignon, the herbal—almost vegetal—scent of unripe Cabernet dominates this wine. It's plump and round in the mouth, yet has a distinctly unripe character to it. If you can, track down the 2001 instead—it's much better. Imported by Admiral Wine Imports."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,13,"Blending Alvarinho and Trajadura, oenologist Anselmo Mendes has created a deliciously creamy but dry style of Vinho Verde. The citrus character is there, but the texture is open, just hints of apple skins over the apricots and white peaches."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,30,"A blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon, with Touriga Nacional, to give a tight wine, solid, taking its austerity from the 2006 vintage. The berry fruits offer structure, and allow the wine to finish with a fresh note."
Portugal,Fernão Pires,White,88,10,"A full, weighty, fat wine, almost new world Chardonnay in its texture and richness. It does come back to its roots, though, with the fresh melon and pear flavors in front of a definite mineral background. A food white, for good fish dishes, perhaps with spice."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,9,"The lovely spritz of fresh Vinho Verde bubbles out of the glass of this lively, crisp and citrus-flavored wine. It has the right edge of fruit skins giving structure to the summer fruits and acidity."
Portugal,Malvasia Fina,White,88,15,"From a 73-acre vineyard, owned by Quinta dos Roques, on the slopes of the Serra de Estrella, Portugal's highest mountains. With 10% wood aging, this is has a light vanilla touch, but that is quickly mixed with the ripe lemon and honey, peach and cantaloup melon flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,17,"A ripe and smooth wine, flavored with pears, white peach and spiced with gentle new wood. The touch of minerality comes from the chalk soils of the vineyards. The finish, though, comes back to smoothness, with an edge of acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,10,"A fine, ripe wine, with big, bold tannins, solid fruit and a structured black juice character. It is definitely rich in texture, but at the same time has a tight, mineral edge and restraint."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,15,"A ripe, full-bodied wine, the yellow peach and apricot flavors balanced with grapefruit, spice and a pear skin structure. There is a hint of vanilla from the wood, with a final, enticing floral character."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,6,"A big dense wine, as tough as the rocks that make up the Dão soil. Its fruit is certainly there, a welter of black berries and plums. But in this young wine, the tannins are still in charge. This is going to develop, opening up, becoming less mineral, over the next three years."
Portugal,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Red,87,38,"Literally meaning “Bordeaux soup,” this is a blend of Bordeaux varieties, including 25% Petit Verdot. It is big and powerful, with a hugely deep color, solid tannins and sweet acidity. Great juicy wafts come through the dark tannins."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,6,"Pear and creamy apples round out a soft, fruity wine. The Arinto grapes give a plum skin tightness to the structure, but the main character is of a full, ripe but also fresh wine."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,12,"Floral, fresh aromas burst out of the glass in this green, crisp wine. There is a creamy element to it, probably from the Alvarinho in the blend, giving the wine some richness. But in the end, this is all about lightness, summer drinking with seafood."
Portugal,Syrah,Red,87,17,"There are few Syrahs in Portugal—some in the Alentejo—but this comes from the coastal region of Bairrada. It shows all the rich, violet and black plum juice varietal character, very juicy. There is spice from wood, but this and the soft tannins meld easily into the rich fruit."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,11,"Ripe, soft and fruity, with dense sweet fruit. The wine is approachable, an enticing mix of tannins, spice and coffee. With its fruity finish, the wine is sure to please. The quinta was owned by the local postman, and correio is the word for post in Portuguese."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,11,"A fresh, ripe red wine, with spice and sweet fruit. There is a simple, attractive juicy character, accompanied by soft tannins. The fruit is fresh and berry-flavored, just brushed by wood."
Portugal,Fernão Pires,White,86,9,"Full, soft wine, with fruit that is rich and gentle. The acidity is what keeps this broad wine together. The green apple and white berry fruits add texture, with just a touch of spice."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,10,"A full-bodied, ripe wine from the Dão. It has the classic minerality of the region, as well as solid fruit, dark tannins and spice. The combination of juicy sweetness and firm, dry tannins is very successful."
Portugal,Arinto,White,86,7,"The brand Bucellas (with two “l”s) has been made by Caves Velhas for years. It remains a light, fresh, crisp wine, all white berry fruits, green plums and lively acidity. A great seafood wine."
Portugal,Tinta Roriz,Red,86,8,"TR stands for Tinta Roriz, the dominant grape in this blended wine (with Touriga Nacional). It is smooth, polished, with a spice and mint character, juicy and fruity. The tannins may be dry, but they in no way inhibit the exuberant fruit."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,10,"A bright, tight, citrus-flavored wine, with a great mineral streak over fresh, creamy acidity. There are lovely wafts of fresh apple juice. A delicious wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,17,"Spicy, toasty, full-bodied and fruity, this is a wine that is packed with plums, fresh red fruits, and a great burst of ripe acidity. Delicious and very accessible."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,9,"In keeping with the austerity of the Dão landscape, this is a taut, mineral-inspired wine, with acidity that sweeps over the black berry fruit. The tannins give a firm core of dryness, but that acidity freshness keeps everything vivid and lively."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,11,"A blend of Baga and Merlot, the Baga giving the tight juiciness, the Merlot rounding the wine out. The wine is fresh, fruity, packed with red berries, with an herbal edge and spice from wood."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,86,8,"Delicious, almost dry rosé, with spice, sweet strawberries and a texture of bright berry skins. There is some depth here, flavors that go right through the wine, finishing with vivid acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,10,"A lively, fresh wine, with crisp green fruits and vivid acidity. There are pineapple and orange zest flavors. This is a fresh, modern white wine, finishing cleanly with a delicious lime juice character."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,8,"Delicious citrus and grape juice aromas, with a vivid, lively dry style that explodes with white fruit and lime flavors. The wine is a great apéritif, or with shellfish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,8,"A blend of Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional, crisply flavored with raspberries and fresh acidity. A dry rosé, which finishes with a bright lift."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,9,"An exotic blend including Pinot Noir and Merlot along with Portuguese varieties, taking its name from two local villages with saints' names. It has acidity and an awkward bitter edge, with tough black fruits. Maybe it needs time for the wine to soften and meld with the tight acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,9,"The perfect summer apéritif, this light, fresh, crisp wine tastes just drier than previous vintages, allowing the apple and lemon fruits to shine even more. It has a tight, taut aftertaste, leaving the mouth clean and refreshed. Screwcap."
Portugal,Chardonnay,White,85,13,"Creamy, green plum- and wood-flavored Chardonnay, clean, somewhat anonymous. Hints of citrus and acidity help keep the wine fresh, giving a final, easy crisp finish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,19,"This is the greatest of the quintas planted by Dona Antonia Ferreira in the 19th century. It is in the Douro Superior, the driest, most remote part of the Douro. The Olazabal family, descendants of Dona Antonia, produce this hugely impressive, dark-hued wine, packed with dense, brooding tannins and solid, initially tough fruits, which open out to opulence and richness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,150,"Dark, dense and concentrated, with power and elegance. But somehow this complex wine also shows restraint and style. It has much to do with the pure richness of the fruit (from 90-year-old vines) as the acidity which lifts and restrains the power."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,10,"A crisp, fresh white wine, with clean acidity and a forward, easy lemon and melon character, with a hint of honey from the Malvasia Fina grapes in the blend."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,70,"The top wine in the Quinta do Portal range is in its second vintage. With 12 months aging in French oak, the power is all there in very dark, heavy tannins that dominate the fruit. This is a powerful expression of the richness and the structure of great Douro wines, all granite and mineral in character, dark and tough, sure to age well."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,56,"The joint venture between the Cazes family of Bordeaux and the Roquette family of Quinta do Crasto in the Douro is in its second released vintage. This is made using Bordeaux techniques, resulting in a style that is more structured than many Douro wines, exploiting ripe fruit with solid tannins, leavened by sweetness and sweet red fruits. The wood shows through on the finish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,29,"A hugely juicy wine, dominated by Touriga Nacional, leavened by dry tannins. It's big, ripe, with vivid red fruits giving spice and power. Immediately attractive now, it is likely to age well over the next 5–8 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,50,"An impressively powerful wine, with concentrated fruit from old vines. It packs dense tannins, layers flavors of ripe figs, plums and raisins, along with wood flavors. The quinta is close to Regua in the western part of the Douro vineyards, a region particularly well suited to powerful but still elegant table wines."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,8,"Soft, ripe wine, with easy flavors of juicy black berries, fresh acidity and sweet tannins. A wine with only a hint of dryness, which is ready to drink."
Portugal,Bical,White,85,9,"Initially a tightly textured, apple and pear skin flavored wine. As it opens up, it shows creamy, fresh fruit, with pear and white currant freshness, finished with green walnuts and a burst of acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,7,"This is a featherlight red, full of berries and bright acidity, but with a texture that just coats the palate. This is one of those rare reds that works as an apéritif, fresh, clean and fruity. Screwcap."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,13,"Full-bodied, soft wine, with pleasant, open flavors of melon, lime and ripe white figs. There is sweetness, emphasizing the softness of the wine. Pleasant and drinkable now."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,7,"This familiar brand of Vinho Verde has long been in a sweeter style. But this latest vintage seems to have brought out the fresh, crisp fruits, and pushed back the sweetness. The result is a delicious summer apéritif style that leaves a clean, light taste in the mouth."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,29,"This estate, managed by the Symington family, is a great Douro property by any standard. This hot 2003 vintage is properly big and dense, but the elegance and style of the estate shows through, with delicious ripe plum flavors over the new wood. Age this for at least 6 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,125,"From a single vineyard at Quinta do Crasto, this wine was fermented in open lagars. It is big, perfumed, packed with superripe fruit. It could almost be too much, but the spice, pepper and dense tannins are restrained by an edge of acidity. It promises long-term aging."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,8,"A tight, freshly acid wine, with stalkiness but also good juicy fruit. There is a green pepper element, leaving a wine that is light, simple."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,49,"The name refers to the big meander the Douro river takes around the quinta's vineyards, forming a long peninsula. Like its big brother, the quinta wine, this reflects the heat and the concentrated fruit that comes from this famed vineyard. Its tannins are almost impenetrable at this stage, deep and dry, needing several years of aging to reveal the solid, ripe dark, spicy flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,54,"The darkest, most impressive version of the Duas Quintas brand, this Reserva is made in the open lagars, from foot-trodden grapes in the tradition still used by major Port houses. It gives a ripe, sweet, almost Port-like character, but still firmed by structure and dusty tannins to go with the superripe plums."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,8,"A soft wine, creamy and ripe. The flavors are open, with white fruits, green plums, a baked apple character. There is acidity, but with the gentle, ripe fruit, this blends in easily. For early drinking."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,10,"A soft, clean, fruity wine, with spice and a fresh, aromatic character. The lemon and white fruit flavors are in an easy, apéritif style, with a lightly sweet aftertaste."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,84,13,"A fresh, bone-dry rosé, packed with acidity, red currants and a touch of caramel. The wine is light, summery, good for apéritif or food."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,8,"It takes a while for the taste of this light, fresh white to come through. Then, it is soft, creamy textured, flavored with pear juice and lemon zest. It is simple, easy, cleanly made."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,8,"A fresh, slightly sweet rosé, that keeps crispness through its bright, breezy strawberry flavors. The wine is soft, crisp, clean, a summer rosé."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,100,"The fine, ripe, structured character of Touriga Nacional is well evident here. It may be big in alcohol, but the wine wears that easily, going more for fresh tannins and acidity, for black currant and dark plum flavors and smooth, vanilla flavors from the French wood aging."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,17,"Structured, rich, but also with good fresh acidity, this is one of the best wines in the Quinta do Portal range. It has lively, vibrant red fruit, along with dry tannins, some vanilla from wood aging. Great acidity in the aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,23,"From Aliança's Alentejo Terrugem vineyard, this dense, tannin-packed wine has powerful flavors of dark fruits, a very dry backbone and layer upon layer of tarry, smoky tastes. Initially it overwhelms with its richness, but that softens and the acidity gives the wine a lifted vibrancy."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,84,11,"Although it lacks the creamy crispness of Alavarinho from Vinho Verde, this certainly has the right lemon and cantaloup melon flavors. There is a lift and freshness to it, aided by the tight pear skin structure. The finish is a letdown, though, with a cardboard and green pea character."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,6,"Soft and fruity, the fruit light, flavored with plum jelly and dried fruits. The wine is soft, somewhat unfocused, the tannins giving some dryness, but leaving a feeling of old-fashioned over-ripe fruits."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,60,"The Quinta da Leda is high up the Douro, in the remote regions of Douro Superior. This 2004 shows the concentration of the fruit in the dark tannins, the toasty new wood and the ripe dark plum fruits. It is smooth enough to drink now, but the tannins promise 5–6 years aging."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,40,"Old vines in this case means 70-year-old vines. Featuring blackberry fruit flavors, along with plums, sweet and rich, this shows a dense, herbal character, dry tannins, lifted by acidity to finish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,25,"A rare Portuguese Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend, made with the involvement of Bordeaux winemaker Pascal Chatonnet, working with Caves Aliança's winemaker Francisco Antunes. Does it work? Yes, as a delicious curiosity. There is no connection with Portugal, but there is smooth new wood, and some pepper from alcohol. Then tannins are dry, the fruit is very ripe and very rich."
Portugal,Fernão Pires,White,83,9,"A very soft, open style of wine. It has ripe white pear and spice flavors, but everything is muted. It is clean, fresh, with some lemon flavors just creeping in finally."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,18,"This joint venture between the inspired winemaker Domingos Soares Franco and Cristiano van Zeller produces fascinatingly idiosyncratic wines. Big and bold, but then lean and tannic, with sunshine-filled fruit over dark tannins. Consumers wanting an action-packed wine, needing time to come together (when it will be superb), should go for this."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,42,"A powerful, solid wine, packed with luscious fruit. The perfumes and the ripeness of the fruit are currently covered with a firm tannin layer, but this should develop well as a medium-term wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,50,"This wine has the dark fruit typical of this quinta, but this year shows more elegance than usual, with dusty tannins and concentrated, sweet fruit."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,82,5,"A sweet, soft, clean wine, anonymous almost. Yes, there is freshness, lightness, but all the time the awkward, unbalancing sweetness pulls it down. Drink very chilled."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,12,"Very dense tannins dominate big ripe blackberry jam flavors. The wine is hugely rich, but sustains itself by the structure which is dry, dusty tannin-dominated, with just a hint of fruit. To finish, there are juicy, fresh flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,38,"The Olazabal/Ferreira family owns two Douro quintas, this and Vale Meão, high up-river. Vallado is in a cooler, wetter climate, and produces elegant wines, in a modern, smooth style. Based on one of the lesser Port grapes, the Sousão, this is full of black currant fruits and new wood flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,32,"The two Ramos-Pinto quintas of Ervamoira and Bons Ares provide contrasting fruit—the hot, dry conditions of Ervamoira and the more temperate climate of Bons Ares. Together, with this coffee and oak flavored wine, built upon ripe fruits, they make an impressive combination of dark, spicy flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,13,"Ramos-Pinto's benchmark wine, a classic in the Douro, made from the two quintas of Ervamoira and Bons Ares, is as good as ever. It is firm but but not powerful, with black fruits, freshened by acidity, leaving a wine that is a touch mineral."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,20,"From Ferreira's own vineyards in the Douro, this smooth, ripe, wood laden wine is spicy, with blackberry fruits, a shot of dark tannins, and fresh, juicy acidity. Age for another 2–3 years before drinking."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,88,20,"A huge wine, full of soft fruit. The layers of tannins sit gently on the plum and cassis fruits, lifted by acidity. If it wasn't 15.5%, this would be impressive, but the high alcohol makes the wine very Port-like, giving an extra layer of pepper from the alcohol."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,14,"A hugely rich wine, packed with dried fruit flavors and spice from aging in American oak. This is a dense blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira and Cabernet Sauvignon, merging well together, the Cabernet giving structure, the other grapes the rich, smooth texture and black fruits."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,8,"A firm, dry lean wine, with some tough tannins, but also with great red fruits and good freshness. This young Dão, with its blend of Tinta Roriz, Jaen and Touriga Nacional, is likely to develop, with its tannins and acidity softening. At the moment, freshness is the key."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,20,"A wine that relies on delicious primary fruit flavors, fresh and lively, with acidity, soft but typically dry Douro tannins and red fruit flavors. A delicious, fresh wine."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,13,"Zingy, touched with honey and ripe, soft fruits. Flavors of green plum, thyme and lime gives this lift and a light, white aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,13,"At three years, Ramos-Pinto's branded Adriano (named after the founder of the company) is at its best. This 2004 vintage is big-hearted, with bitter chocolate and blackberry fruits, as well as generous tannins. Good, dry structure and fresh acidity complete a rounded picture."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,20,"Vallado's simplest wine is all big, black, crisp fruit leaping out of the glass. While it is not light, it certainly has a lilt and freshness to it, despite the dry tannins which underlie the flavors. Herbs and spices add to the pleasure."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,11,"Beefy, burly wine, shot through with dry Dão tannins, dry and firm. The fruit is juicy, lightly rustic, with high acidity coming through its rich meat gravy flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,13,"A fresh, lively, citrus-flavored wine with touches of white peaches and a soft structure. Give this 6 months in bottle for the freshness to peak."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,13,"A structured, ripe wine, leavened with a base of dry tannins. It is full of ripe blueberry fruit flavors and juicy freshness. A little stalky, but easy, soft and ready to drink."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,10,"This is one of Portugal's big brands. Soft, easy and juicy, this has  just a touch of dryness and great, fresh aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,8,"A fruity, juicy wine, all ripe raspberries and red plum skins. It is fresh, with a layer of dry tannins, but more fruit than structure."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,20,"With black fruits, very ripe and sweet, this is a stylish LBV. It is on the fruity side, although with an added substructure of tannin. Soft, rounded and very ready to drink, finishing with perfumed swathes of fruit."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,10,"This is a ripe, full wine, retaining Vinho Verde's classic taut acidity, but rounded out with sweet apple and lime flavors. It's food friendly and would make for a fine apéritif."
Portugal,Alicante Bouschet,Red,87,17,"The Alicante Bouschet grape's red juice has produced a wine of intensely dark color. The texture is creamy, and the flavors of berry and coffee are rounded. There is a fine touch of spice, although pepper from the alcohol does intrude."
Portugal,Arinto,White,87,17,"One of a series of varietal wines from Terra d'Alter, this Arinto is full of the grape's typical floral, fragrant character. It has lemon and lime flavors that are laced with acidity. It's delicious, fruity and ready to drink."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,16,"Powerful and complex, this is solid and impressive, made from a selection of wines. It is dark, dense, full of blackberry fruit and dry tannins. The wood aging still shows in the spiciness, while the tight fruit flavors bring out the acidity. Drink this wine from 2016."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,18,"DFJ Vinhos manages this 16th century property which has produced a now mature wine. It has great balance, the berry fruits moving to secondary flavors of spice, smokiness, sweet tannins and hints of toast. It's ready to drink, but will continue to develop through 2017."
Portugal,Alvarinho-Chardonnay,White,87,9,"Two complementary grapes produce this ripe wine that's full of citrus flavors and balanced with pear and peach. It's rounded and rich in its texture, with a touch of honey to go with the lemon acidity on the finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,23,"Dried fruit with great freshness in this warm, rounded 10-year-old tawny. It has delicious acidity, ripe fruitiness and a caramel richness. Like all aged tawnies, it is ready to drink."

Portugal,Port,Red,91,22,"On the dry side, typical of Dow's, a wine with jellied fruits kept behind firm, young tannins. The wine has definite acidity, bracketing the tannins and dark fruits. The perfumed aftertaste is fresh, but still keeping that dry core."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,12,"Light, fresh, with some caramel and dried fruit flavors. This is a lightweight tawny, going more for freshness, with touches of raisins to finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,11,"Blackberry jam aromas, fresh, ripe jammy fruits, backed with sweet jelly and only lightly touched by spirit. A sweet, soft style, very easy."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,60,"A vineyard selection is used to make this powerful, super ripe wine. With its opulent flavors, it is as densely packed with fruit as it is with tannins. Balanced and gorgeous, this is ready to drink now, yet it will age over several years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,40,"This is powerfully impressive, with its firm structure giving great depth to the rich black-cherry and plum fruits. Dense and tannic, it needs to age for at least four years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,55,"An impressive, serious wine that's only produced in top vintages. It's elegant and complex, a powerful wine with its dark tannins, licorice and black plum flavors. Concentrated and intense, it's worth aging for at least four years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,70,"Initial new wood flavors show the youth of this complex wine. Then it fills out in the mouth with an explosive blackberry flavor and dense fruit tannins. With its power and flavor intensity, it has firm potential to age over at least five years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,55,"A dark-colored, wood-aged wine, this is serious and power­ful. It has tannic weight along with a black­berry flavor, and a smooth tar and herb layer that's all balanced by the acidity. The wood still needs another year to fully integrate; age for another 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,45,"Powerful and ripe, this is loaded with dark black fruit, spice from wood aging, licorice and bitter chocolate flavors. It's impressively rich, concentrated and dark in both color and feel; age it for four years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,20,"Huge and rich, this offers ripe black fruits and a concentrated structure. It's packed with a seemingly sweet blackberry flavor that serves as a counterpoint to the firm texture. With both density and a dark edge, this will age over several years."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,84,9,"A blend of Touriga Nacional and Alfrocheiro grapes, this crisp, lightweight rosé shows tight cranberry acidity, layered with some caramel and it finishes dry and fresh."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,159,"This is definitely old, an acquired taste perhaps, the wine showing high wood acidity, with a tight character. Any fruit has gone, leaving pure acidity and a very mature texture."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,25,"Bottled unfiltered (which means there is a sediment in the bottle), this is a fine wine, on the dry side, with firm tannins, fresh acidity and flavors of dried fruits. It has a solid, possibly ageworthy character."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,35,"Delicious sweet raisin and mulled wine fruit, full of herbs and nutmeg spice. This is a ripe wine, but too heavy, showing some austerity, but no sign of tiring."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,19,"This is a ruby reserve, bright red/black in color, with youthful fruity freshness. There are black fruits, with an edge of stalkiness, but ripely sweet at the same time. The aftertaste reveals good balancing acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,70,"Deep and dark, this has powerful herb and spice flavors alongside the concentrated tannins and notes of ripe black fruits and raisins. This has impressive density and is still youthful, demonstrating fine aging potential."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,92,13,"The combination of blackberry fruit and firm, dark tannins has created a complex, impressive wine. This has plenty of fruit, but the main components at this stage are its weight and structure. It has considerable aging potential; keep for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,29,"Earthy aromas are a hallmark of the Baga grape, a component of this full-bodied, tannic blend. With weight and richness, a mint note and new wood flavors, it is a serious wine that still should develop over three years."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,18,"Firm, concentrated fruit and dusty tannins. The wine has acidity, freshness and attractive berry and fresh fruit flavors. Fine, vivid acidity completes a harmonious wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,25,"Initially the tannins dominate, but then ripe, sweet jelly and juicy fruit shows through, giving the wine its main character. There is some firm tannin, but the wine enjoys generous sweetness."
Portugal,Port,Red,82,20,"Attractive fresh apple aromas are then spoilt by a rather hard, tart character. The spirit is obvious here, giving an uncomfortable edge."
Portugal,Port,Red,82,23,"A curious aroma of honeysuckle and tomatoes spoils this wine. The texture itself is fine, but it seems to have unripe fruit, very dry and rather lean. It could age, but the starting point doesn't seem promising."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,28,"New-wood dominates this wine, with a very toasty quality, a seemingly sweet vanilla flavor and a touch of pepper from the alcohol. The black fruits are still burried under the wood character, although the fruits' weight suggests they will broaden out with time. Give this powerful effort at least four years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,20,"Dark, with dusty tannins and a solid, firm structure, this has a dense character. The black plum fruit and intense underlying acidity yield a powerful wine that will age over several years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,69,"Firm and structured, this is a densely rich wine for aging. Firm tannins dominate its ripe black fruit, lending notes of spice, licorice and toast from the wood. It needs several years of aging to round out—give it four years at least."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,83,10,"Perfumed wine, reeking of candy shops and sweet fruits. There are lychee, spice, pear, a cornucopia of delights. Just a touch of acidity creates a wine that is designed more for apéritif than for food."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,25,"A solid, chunky wine, its tannins giving a tight edge of dryness. Acidity and really juicy fruit make the wine accessible, with great dried raisins coming through strongly and deliciously."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,15,"Densely tannic wine, certainly not ready to drink, with dusty tannins over ripe fruit, powered by a dry core of minerality. The wine is solid, with structure first and rich fruit after."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,26,"A full-bodied wine, showing the richness and super-ripe grapes of 2003. It is soft, with dusty tannins showing through the ripe damsons and almost jammy character. It's all well in balance."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,30,"From its almost black color, it's obvious this is a powerful wine. The wood aging is initially apparent, with a mint flavor laid over firm, dry tannins. Then comes the ripe berry flavor and acidity. The integrated combination is dark, powerful and ready to age over 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,91,40,"Opulent and wood-aged, this feels intense and rounded with a ripe Burgundian feel. The full weight of the peach and apricot fruits are given a powerful push by the toast, spice and vanilla flavors. Age this for 2–3 years."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,61,"Approaching tawny in color, this is a mature white Port. It has a wood-aged tang, with spice and toast flavors that have given the wine an old gold feel. The surface is sweet, yet there is an underlying dryness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,16,"This is an austere wine that blossoms slowly. Using grapes sourced from a vineyard at an elevation of 2,000 feet, this has a wild herb character along with dark black fruits and tannins that need several years to age. Give this very ageworthy effort at least four years."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,22,"Very ripe young fruit, a damson and sweet plum juice flavor, with a touch of stalkiness as well as richness. The wine bursts with fruit, although finally quite dry, with a complex, dark texture."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,12,"Concentrated and powerful, this is a rich and intense black-fruited wine. Notes of spice, herb and dark chocolate mingle with the flavor of black plum juice and firm, dry tannins. The result is a wine that needs several more years to age."
Portugal,Touriga Franca,Red,91,45,"An impressive single varietal wine, this shows notes of spice, black currant and wood, along with dark tannins and a firm, dry core. With its acidity and tannins, this will likely age over several years."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,91,25,"Wood-aged, this is a ripe-textured wine that has rich flavors of yellow and white fruits and toast. It has concentrated, intense fruit that bursts in the mouth. Delicious and impressive, this could be aged for another two years."
Portugal,Alicante Bouschet,Red,91,13,"This is deeply colored and rich, showing both the juicy fruit character of Alicante Bouschet and a more serious, concentrated element. It's solid and densely tannic, with wood flavors layered on its black plum fruit. This is worth aging for another two years."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,13,"A deliciously rich, sweet and youthfully fruity wine that has an opulent feel to it. There is a juicy element, with fresh acidity, but most of the character comes from the ripe fruit, the jelly character and the sweet tannins. It needs more bottle age."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,25,"A wine that has the characteristic 2004 perfume character, with vanilla, almost opulent fruits and layers of nutmeg. There are blackberry and apple pie flavors and firm, dry tannins. Bottled unfiltered, suggesting aging potential."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,22,"This fine wine is still on the young side, with tannins dominating fruit, followed by acidity and cranberry juice character. It is dry, with just a touch of sweetness and a dry, tight aftertaste. This needs some bottle age—two years at least."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,19,"Full bodied and rich, this has a juicy core followed by firm, minerally tannins and intense acidity. Wood aging adds complexity to this impressive, ageworthy effort."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,16,"This is both fruity and mineral driven, a combination that gives intense structure surrounded by ripe black fruit. Chocolate and spice notes come from the wood aging. All of the elements come together in a powerful, full-bodied effort that should age for three years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,20,"Richly structured and ripe, this has black tannins laced with dark plum fruit. Its tannins promise aging while its fruit already offers a rounded taste. Keep for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,15,"Using grapes sourced from old vines, this is dark and concentrated. It's dominated at the start by firm, dry tannins, with its power coming from its dark, brooding fruit and dense structure. Age for at least four years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,70,"The top red from Adega Mayor, this is serious and impressive. Its firm, dry and dusty tannins are balanced by an intense blackberry flavor and contrasted with licorice and coffee notes. As it ages, it will become more intense and elegant."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,22,"Very raisiny, the fresh fruit soft and juicy. Cranberry and spice flavors give a purity of berry fruits and sweet acidity. It is very accessible, with all the elements well in place."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,30,"This is drier than some 10-year-old Tawnys, showing a taste of wood, with acidity and the fig and raisin flavors behind the mature flavors. This is all suggests that much of the wine in the blend is older than 10 years, giving extra richness and depth of flavor."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,55,"Dark in color, the wine has very rich fruit flavors spiced with cinnamon, tasting like Christmas coffee, the tannins firm, with a dry structure. Black plum skins dominate."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,95,70,"One of Portugal's great wines, this epitomizes the minerality and the rich, dark fruit of the Douro. It is intensely structured, powered by dark tannins, with rich berry fruit, layers of wood and acidity. With the extra freshness and pure fruits that are typical of 2008, this will age for many years."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,26,"A rich, extravagantly spicy wine, the fruit showing sweet raisins and dried figs. The tannins are soft and generous, with good ripe fruit. This is an open, soft wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,15,"A ripe wine, touched with caramel, plenty of spice and acidity as well as a tight, tannic edge. The start is sweet, but the wine soon veers drier, leaving acidity as well as the firmest tannins."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,72,"Big, powerful wine that is restrained by its ripe, dusty tannins. It is concentrated, with an almost Port-like texture, a result of the open lagars in which it is fermented. The fruit is likely to be rich and opulent as the tannins move into balance."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,36,"Big, smoky wood flavored wine. At this stage, it is all tannins, wood and dark spice. With the weight of fruit, though, it should develop into a solid and rich wine, layering its tannins with sweet black plum flavors."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,20,"A big-hearted, fruity wine. With its ripe tannins and red berry fruits, this red is certainly powerful, but it manages to keep its balance, finishing ripe and sweet. This is a wine that could be enjoyed now, but would certainly age over the next 4–5 years."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,23,"A heavy, powerful wine, with very concentrated tannins. Flavors of licorice, bitter chocolate and black plums give a sense of richness and opulence. Still young, the aromas are yeasty, but these should open up for a rich, dense wine."

Portugal,Alicante Bouschet,Red,89,16,"The juiciness of Alicante Bouschet shows well in this full-bodied wine, packed with black berries and soft tannins. The dry finish suggests some aging—maybe 1 year."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,83,8,"Very soft and easy going, this has rounded peach and apple flavors. The acidity is light, hinting at citrus. Screwcap."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,25,"This is a big, bold, extracted selection that has a burnt edge to it from the wood. It's tannic and structured, and the note of black plum skin is lost at this stage in its life. It does have the weight to integrate well, so give it 3–4 years."
Portugal,Sousão,Red,89,40,"Known for its ability to produce deeply colored wine, Sousão has made a wine with a rough-edged character, which gives it a firm, solid and chunky feel. A dense layer of acidity adds balance. Age for 1–2 years."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,89,50,"Soft and fruity, with a round texture, this shows attractive melon and quince flavors, bearing a hint of bright acidity at the back. It has weight, an oily texture and lemon freshness on the finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,68,"Dry, firm and toasty, this has acidity over a tight black currant character. That makes it feel almost as much wine as Port, the woody character adding to the dry side."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,7,"Touched by the ocean breezes, this vineyard has long ripening, cool-climate characteristics. And this blend of Castelão, Camarate, Tinta Miúda and Touriga Nacional is elegant, with soft, velvet tannins balancing well with the plum skin and the refreshing acidity. It all holds together very well."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,10,"Vinified by the winemaking team of Dão Sul, this is a blend of Touriga Nacional, Alicante Bouschet and Syrah, a rich, wild blend, with smooth blackberry jelly fruits, an edge of astringency, and a layer of toast from the eight months wood aging."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,82,10,"Lean and austere, this brings out the mineral character of the Dão region without expressing the richer fruit side. It has tannins, juicy acidity and a tight, severe finish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,25,"Wood-aged and almost black in color from the ripe, sweet berry fruit flavors and the velvet, opulent layers of polished wood and tannins. It's certainly a powerhouse of flavors, but the dry core keeps it from being out of balance, while the aftertaste is sweet and dry at the same time. Impressive."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,32,"Meat, bacon and plum skin aromas are followed by dense, ripe tannins, piled on by black, solid fruits. This is a powered, intense wine, with superrich fruit, but encased in dry tannins."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,37,"A young, powerful wine, dominated by bitter chocolate, cocoa and dense ripe black fruits. The wood element lifts this mix of flavors and gives a great sense of structure. Dark figs and herbs add complexity, while the tannins are powerful."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,12,"This big, bold, structured offering is full of ripe blackberry flavor and integrated tannins. It is intensely rich and already delicious. Bomfim is the main winery for the Dow Port brand."
Portugal,Aragonês,Red,88,20,"Smooth, wood-polished wine, packed with a ripe, comfortable texture, very ripe red fruits, highlights of tannins. There are black figs, balanced with sweet acidity and fattened with some bacon flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,7,"An impressive, dense wine, this is a wood-aged, smooth blend of Aragonez and Castelão grapes. This has ripe tannins and fruit, and a rich blend of blackberries and dark plums."
Portugal,Arinto,White,92,14,"Pure Arinto from the Lisbon region, this wood-aged wine is delicious and Chardonnay-like in its richness, with great swathes of apples and cream flavors, layered with toast. This is a great advertisement for a neglected region in Portugal's viticulture."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,15,"A powerful, punchy wine that brings richness along with acidity to a blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Barocca and Tinta Roriz. The smoothness of the surface hides firm, dusty tannins, with wild fig and dark plum flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,19,"Huge weight and alcohol show strongly in this powerful wine. Its flavors, almost jammy in their ripeness, include sweet plum and damson. It needs to age for at least four years."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,14,"This full-bodied selection hails from the same region as Vinho Verde, offering creamy apricot and ripe white-fruit notes. It has great depth of flavor, with toast and spice tones as well as fragrant acidity."
Portugal,Verdelho,White,88,17,"Lightly spicy aromas give this an exotic feel. At the same time, there is plenty of crisp, citrusy acidity, along with a rounded melon texture. The wine is full-bodied, concentrated and will be ready to drink in six months."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,13,"Fruity and structured wine, with flavors of black pepper, red currant fruits, acidity as well as some soft tannins. A blend of Alicante Bouschet. Aragonez and Castelão, produced in a small region just north of Lisbon."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,18,"A powerful expression of Portuguese varieties, with dense tannins, dark fruit flavors and ripeness. If the alcohol is too high—and it shows in the pepper edge to the wine—it still has a sense of shape and structure."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,87,11,"An unexpected combination perhaps, but it works to give a fresh, flavorful wine, with soft tannins, juicy fruit and flavors of red cherries and vanilla. Not complex, and ready to drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,10,"The estate wine from Casal Branco is impressive and structured, with dried berry fruits, dark, dry tannins and a solid structure. The acidity is very present, helping to keep the wine fresh, but the complex dark flavors and spice are certainly there to allow the wine to age over the next 3–4 years."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,75,"This Port is structured, with notes of mint and herb. It has blackberry jam flavor and a firm, solid structure, while it also shows intense youthful fruitiness. It is rich and full, showing some firm tannins. Either drink it right now, or leave it for 10 years."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,8,"This is a bone-dry, piercingly fresh wine. It has tense acidity and a mineral texture that would make it delicious as an accompaniment to seafood. The wine is crisp, refreshing and bright."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,8,"Perfectly ready to drink, this full-bodied red, a blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira, Alfrocheiro and Castelão, is rich and spicy, packed with baked plum and layered with tannins. It tastes concentrated and solidly ripe."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,17,"This is light and bright, with crisp acidity and the fruitiness of an attractive, early-drinking wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,16,"Smooth and rounded, this has the dense character of Douro wines, with open flavors of spice and black currant. The junior wine of Quinta de la Rosa, this is balanced and will be ready to drink in a year."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,15,"Showcasing the richness of 2009 without sacrificing fine structure, this is stylish and concentrated. Dark black fruit accompanies a tight, minerality and a fine shaft of acidity. This single-vineyard offering is worth aging for 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,7,"Freshly perfumed, almost sweet in character. It has flavors that hint at fruit candies, the acidity so light, the structure so gentle."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,68,"Dark in color, with spice and some concentration. The wine, though, is spoiled by volatility and a huge and unbalancing acidity. Nor is the spirit really integrated."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,30,"The second wine from Malhadinha Nova is lively and fruity, packed with red fruits, sweet strawberry flavors and easy, ripe texture. Drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,14,"No prizes from Portuguese varietal experts for guessing that this is a blend with Touriga (Nacional and Franca) and Tinta Roriz. The wine itself is rounded, soft and sweet, with sweet black plums just touched by acidity, but more about open tannins and rich, dried fruits."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,55,"A wine that seems weighed down by its own structure. It is all solid tannins, darkness, the fruit not really able to express itself. Powerful and concentrated, this needs more time to develop, although the direction of the wine is still problematic."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,18,"This is the last vintage of a joint venture between J M da Fonseca and Cristiano van Zeller (the 2005 is a solo production by J M da Fonseca). It's a dry, dark, structured wine, with some minerality, full of ripe black plums and concentrated tannins."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,35,"Dark fruits are the backbone of this fine wine, with flavors of blueberries, black cherry and figs along with smooth, polished wood. It is certainly big and dense, the tannins soft but concentrated. The finish is juicy and fruity, but dry."
Portugal,Alfrocheiro,Red,88,17,"This wood-aged selection is soft and opulently smooth, with milk chocolate and black cherry flavors. It has some concentration, which is overlaid by its soft texture. Ready to drink."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,20,"This is the entry-level wine from Vallado, bright and fruity, with an attractive red-berry flavor and a solid, tannic core. As is typical with the 2010 vintage, it has some structure and should be aged for another year."
Portugal,Vinhão,Red,88,18,"If any producer is going to make sense of Vinhão in red Vinho Verde, it's biodynamic producer Casal do Paço Padreiro. This has some richness as well as the typical cool-climate acidity, with a touch of spice and a balanced, smooth finish. Drink within the year."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,19,This full-bodied white is rich and creamy. The dominating wood and ripe apricot notes are cut with pineapple-tinged acidity to produce a round yet clean finish.
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,13,"Smoky, meaty aromas, with bacon flavors, bitter coffee and spice. It is rustic, its texture ragged around the edge. A wine that demands spicy barbecue food."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,9,"Soft wine, with simple pear and white currant fruit flavors. It tastes flat, one-dimensional, the acidity muted."
Portugal,Trincadeira,Red,87,20,"A big, juicy wine with balancing acidity and bright red fruit flavors. This is full of freshness and fruit flavors, with only soft tannins to hold the flavors together."
Portugal,Aragonês,Red,87,8,"Dense tannins dominate this wine. The black currant and blackberries are layered under this intense structure, with wood and acidity giving the wine backbone and a vibrant, juicy aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,15,"This rich, smooth wine is driven by its ripe fruitiness. It is warm and rounded, combining black and red fruit with a harmonizing shot of licorice. Give it a few months, but it is nearly ready to drink."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,88,17,"This is a creamy, intensely fruit wine, with lime and tropical fruit flavors, merely hinting at a minerally structure. It's delicious and ready to drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,16,"This second wine from Quinta de Roriz is ripe, warm and ready to drink. With its ripe black fruits, soft tannins, layers of wood spices and just a hint of acidity, it's a rich offering from a big vintage."
Portugal,Bastardo,Red,84,30,"A very light-colored wine, almost rosé, typical of the Bastardo grape, which has almost disappeared in the Douro. In that sense, this is a curiosity and the farmyard taste says much of why it is rarely found."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,7,"A delicious, ripe and creamy wine, tasting of white fruits. An esoteric blend of Arinto, Fernão Pires, Vital and Chardonnay. It has a good, mineral edge along with lifted, fresh acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,16,"The flagship wine from Alorna is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon, the two grapes melding well into a rich, harmonious whole. Flavors of spice, black figs and dark plum skin tannins are smoothed by 12 months wood aging. There is an edge of youth, which suggests good aging potential."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,90,19,"A dark, brooding wine, packed with black fruits that are dominated by dry tannins. This is still young, but the dense blackberry fruit flavors are all here. Its weight and power need time to tame, but for now, the acidity and fruit are impressive."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,18,"This is marked by bold, dense and rich fruit. It has a sweet, soft character and is deliciously fruity. Packed with blackberry-juice acidity and ripe red plum, this is ready to drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,13,"This finely structured wine from the Quinta dos Murcas estate has ripe flavors of spice and red berry. Its warm feel is shot through with acidity for the perfect amount of tension. You can drink this now, but it would benefit from another year of aging."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,13,Simaens has produced a ripe style of wine here. Apple and rich citrus flavors add a delicious touch to tropical fruit flavors. This wine is fit for drinking in the next few months.
Portugal,Rosé,Red,83,10,"A cherry-pink-colored wine, soft and full-bodied. Flavors are of wild strawberries, red cherry with a touch of pepper. The wine feels fat, missing acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,22,"Only the second garrafeira (the name means special selection) made by the Borba cooperative, this is a serious, complex wine that wears its tannins and rich fruits lightly. The dried fruits, chocolate and edge of bitterness all promise aging potential. There's a fresh, juicy feel to the aftertaste, before the spice from wood aging kicks back in."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,12,"A richly ripe wine, full of tarry, dark tannins and black fruits. Despite its weight and density, it is well balanced, the dark flavors opening out with flavors of licorice, bitter chocolate and spicy wood."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,10,"Soft, warm and lightly tannic, this has an herbaceous character. Its fresh acidity balances its black currant flavor. It is fragrant, fruity and mature; ready to drink."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,12,"Soft and herbaceous, this is a warm wine, its acidity leading to apricot and pineapple flavors. The apple skin texture and the tangy final acidity make it crisp."
Portugal,Loureiro,White,87,14,"This is light—the Ten in the name refers to its alcohol level—dry, crisp and fragrantly fresh. It is citrus dominant and deliciously refreshing—a wine that livens up the palate."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,7,"Soft, light, flavored with raspberry and red fruit. There is a gentle tannin character to this open, fresh wine."
Portugal,Syrah,Red,86,8,"A lean, edgy wine, which shows bramble fruits, red berries and tense tannins. There's fine structure and, given a few months, the acidity will turn this into a good food wine."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,86,19,"The aromas are the thing here, as so often with Touriga Nacional, keeping the soft tannins and ripe, sweet fruit buoyant and lively. There is acidity, but there's more, maybe too much, of blackberry jam flavor."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,14,"Already showing signs of maturity, this is a full, ripe wine, with licorice and black fruit flavors, hinting also at coffee. The wood gives firm but dusty tannins, leaving an openness to the wine, along with an element of spiciness. The aftertaste is full and dry, with good acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,18,"This is all about rich, tarry red fruit flavors, layered with some dense fruit tannins. It's a warm wine from a hot place, concentrated and full. With flavors of superripe black fruits, this could be aged, but is definitely ready to drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,14,"In homage to a major product of the region, this wine has a cork label. It has considerable power, an old-fashioned, astringent wine that keeps the typical ultradry tannins as a sign of its ability to age. The fruit is definitely in second place here, although there are concentrated black fruits in the background. Age for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,13,"A ripe, smooth wine, dominated by juicy Trincadeira that has been tamed by 12 months wood aging. There's great spice, toast, dark berry fruits and good concentration. The tannins and the fine acidity promise aging potential."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,12,"Oscar Quevedo is one member of a new generation of winemakers bringing a breath of fresh air to the Douro. His everyday wines, like this one, are friendly, fruity and delicious when consumed young. This is a great wine for barbecue."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,15,"This relies on its ripe fruit to convey the rich flavors of the Douro. Its black fruit flavors dominate the broad tannic structure, with a light hint of wood aging. It's bold, chunky and ready to drink."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,81,9,"Rustic wine, its fruit angular and its tannins cutting into the wine awkwardly. Final acidity gives more sharpness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,26,"Superripe, with sweet black fruit, and ripe, soft tannins. The structure is here, but the acidity seems to have missed out with such richly ripe black fig flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,9,"With its 5 million bottle production, this is one of Portugal's leading brands. It is a ripe wine, but with a stalky element, giving freshness, although the aftertaste is soft, perhaps sweet, very easy, ripe."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,12,"A finely balanced wine, uniting toast and wood flavors with ripe plums in a harmonious whole. There are spice, soft tannins and light acidity. Elegant rather than powerful, this is an excellent food wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,15,"A fine, firm, structured wine that shows richness along with elegance. Fresh, black fruits ride over dry tannins and acidity, allowing this to be a food-friendly wine that could benefit from some aging. To finish, the lifted, vibrant fruits leave a ripe, clean taste."
Portugal,Malvasia Fina,White,89,20,"Sweet citrus-flavored wine, with a good intensity of flavor from the ripe Malvasia grapes. There's a delicious perfumed character, pineapple and tangerine. The acidity is a fine part of this rich wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,20,"Soft and rich, this is powerful stuff. The texture is velvety smooth, the dark tannins very much second fiddle to the superripe fruit. Raisins and red fruits bring in some acidity, but even this fruit flavor is almost sweet in its richness. Drink now."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,89,14,"Ripe, smooth, velvet textured wine, layering dark chocolate, black plum skins, dense tannins and a big, solid structure. It tastes powerful from the ripe tannins and big fruit, finishing with fresh acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,28,"Totally mature, this shows a rustic character and firm, tarry tannins. It is weighty and dense, with a patina of sweet flavors that come with age. Drink it over the next few months."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,20,"Ripe, soft fruits give this wine a rich and open character. It is an attractive, ready-to-drink wine, with added complexity from black plum, spice and herb."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,87,15,"This crisp, lightly spicy wine has attractive red fruit. It's refreshing yet still full and fruity. It's bright and touched by almond and rose hip flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,26,"Ripe fruit, good, even high acidity, a touch of wood: everything is here, except for the nagging edge of rusticity that often pervades the Carmo estate wine. It needs more polish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,8,"Fresh wine, crisp with plenty of sunny red fruits and light acidity. There's a good red currant element, giving a lively lift, with a touch of caramel to finish."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,8,"This dry Vinho Verde shows great crisp, green apple and grapefruit flavors, a deliciously fresh wine, with green edges and lively flavors. Great summer drink."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,14,"A densely tannic wine, dry with bitter dark cocoa and black fruit flavors. The concentration of fruit and tannin is impressive, and gives considerable complexity of fruit as it powers alongside the dryness. It needs aging for the rough edges to smooth out, probably 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,11,"There is an attractive floral and fragrant quality about this wine, along with a light herbaceousness. It is light, though with a good intensity of fruit and a tang of citrus. For drinking now or over the next 2–3 years."
Portugal,Verdelho,White,85,14,"Spicy, aromatic, touched by minerality and chalk, with an intense texture, the wine remains fresh, though, a fine apéritif wine, ending softly."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,9,"A simple fruity red wine, with spice, red-berry fruit flavors, lively acidity and some stalky tannins. This is great quaffing wine, all red fruits and freshness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,26,"A finely perfumed, but also rough-edged wine, with acidity and very dry tannins. It is beginning to show maturity, the tannins edging out the fruit and chocolate flavors and old leather aromas coming through. Drink now."
Portugal,Touriga Franca,Red,88,10,"This wine is flavorful, with plenty of blackberry fruit, as well as a dense, tannic heart. The fruit's edges are smoothed by the wood aging, but it is still fruit that dominates, ripe, hearty and packed with acidity to finish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,16,"Ripe and smooth, balancing dense black fruit flavors with spice, wood and acidity, this is a solid, concentrated wine. It has a good restrained power, although the pepper hints at the alcohol. It certainly demands rich food."
Portugal,Touriga Franca,Red,88,19,"All spice, juicy fruit and dry tannins, this certainly evokes the spirit of the grape. There is a mineral quality to the red berry fruits, which comes through in the youthful, firm edge. Give this wine another two years so the  fruit will open up."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,12,"Very soft, smooth and polished, this favors ripe plums and figs, and ripe, lightweight tannins. It is designed as an easy-going, soft wine, and does the job very well."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,14,"With 4–6 months' wood aging, here is a wine that is smooth, ripe, layered with black, juicy fruits, spoiled by an aftertaste of cured ham from volatility."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,16,"This is an elegant, restrained blend of Tinta Roriz, Castelão, Syrah and Alicante Bouschet, giving ripe fruit to go with the firm, dry tannins and a touch of wood. It could age another 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,16,"A juicy, spicy wine, packed with open, generous black fruits. The blend of Castelão and Trincadeira gives blackberries, some raisins and a smooth chocolate underlay."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,10,"A perfumed, juicy wine with delicious red fruits and well adjusted with acidity. There are good, dry tannins as well, suggesting this will make a good food wine. The aftertaste has chewy structure and acidity."
Portugal,Fernão Pires,White,88,12,"A wood-aged, rich wine that shows big, ripe fruits and a good spice and toast element from the wood, balanced by white nectarines and currants. It is full, rounded and creamy."
Portugal,Tinta Roriz,Red,88,19,"A firm, ripe wine, with great red fruit flavors, dark tannins and an edge of coffee. There is some toast element here in this still young wine. Hopefully the just overripe fruit edge will disappear as it develops."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,13,"This open, juicy wine is a blend dominated by Aragonez and Alicante Bouschet that gives it sweetness and flavors of red berries with a firm underlay of tannin. A wine to drink with spicy foods on a cold day."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,8,"A simple, fruity with great freshness and flavors of lemons, mangos and spice. Attractive, and easy drinking."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional Blend,Red,87,11,"Fast becoming one of the hallmark blends of Portugal, this 50-50 mix of Aragonez and Touriga Nacional is a seriously structured wine, with great wild fruit and mushroom flavors alongside dark, dry tannins. The acidity is very definite. A good food wine."
Portugal,Sousão,Red,84,14,"Bitter chocolate and dried apricots vie with each other in this curious wine. It is certainly too big and rich for its own good, a blockbuster of a wine, but without the complexity that could compensate. What is here are very ripe plums, and a layer of dry, bitter tannins."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,5,"An earthy, rustic blend of Aragonez and Castelão grapes, soft and ripe, touched with black figs and plum skins. For a hearty stew, this is certainly a fine wine, but there's nothing sophisticated about it."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,10,Creamy and full-bodied wine layered with lime and other citrus flavors that highlight acidity although the aftertaste is sweet.
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,10,"Fresh and perfumed, this wine offers great citric flavors, a lively crispness rare in white wines from central Portugal. Pear and some yellow fruits give roundness."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,84,12,"A fresh, red, fruity wine, with flavors of herbs. The tannins are light, leaving an aftertaste of red berries and acidity. Easy and attractive."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,10,"The juicy fruit is dominated by Aragones and Trincadeira. This is a soft wine, simple, open and fresh, touched with acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,23,"A rich, intense wine, a definite step up from the standard Periquita, smooth and packed with sweet, ripe red fruits, the juiciness of the Castelão grape tamed by the wood polish."
Portugal,Alicante Bouschet,Red,83,18,"A juicy wine with cranberry fruit flavors, spice, and exotic berries, spoiled by a rustic, earthy, meaty edge. Not for aging."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,83,9,"Initially fresh, with a creamy, white-fruit texture, this has acidity, but it finishes fat and rather hot, with pepper."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,7,"A blend of Aragonez and Trincadeira, produced by a group of cooperatives in the Alentejo region. It is a simple wine, but has good red fruits, soft, velvet structure and a finishing edge of acidity. Good barbecue wine."
Portugal,Trincadeira,Red,87,14,"Fresh and fruity, this is a wine that's all about juicy textures, ripe fruit, touched by dry tannins. Flavors of tomatoes, red plums and a lively acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,7,"This is Casal Branco's branded wine, designed to be drunk young. And that's exactly how it tastes, with bright, lively fruit, soft tannins, a very light vegetal hint, and a soft, almost jammy aftertaste. Highly enjoyable."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,10,"With what seems a stylistic change, this 2005 version of Periquita is firm, tannic, structured, with dark fruits and plenty of dry tannins. It is impressive for a big brand, dark and concentrated."
Portugal,Bical,White,86,15,"Rounded but also fruity, this soft wine is perfumed, hinting at white flowers and tropical fruits. While the acidity is low, the fruit is easy, ripe and lightly structured."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,17,"A wine that has some acidity, but also tastes somewhat hot. There is some spice from the wood aging, balancing the white plum and stone fruit flavors. What is missing is the acidity."
Portugal,Arinto,White,92,29,"An impressive white wine, made from the classy Arinto grape. The wine has been aged in wood, but the creamy toast blends easily with the rich white fruits. There is a Chardonnay-like richness here, a wine that is round, smooth, with just a final lift of acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,26,"A closed, dark, tight wine, with an austere, mineral character, that obviously needs considerable aging. Smoky, meaty, dark tannins are dominant here, the black berry fruit showing through the powerful structure. Keep for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,34,"A powerful expression of Touriga Nacional, from a single vineyard in the Dão revealing ripe structured fruits along with dark, linear tannins. The wine has spice, but the fruits are darkly dry, with a tense, firm aftertaste. Age for 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,10,"Soft and light, with good black plum and fig flavors. There's a touch of spice, but this is lively, juicy and fresh."
Portugal,Alicante Bouschet,Red,86,11,"It may be a second-rate grape in France, but in Portugal Alicante Bouschet has really come into its own. This is a ripe, smooth wine, with dark plum skin tannins, red peppers and intense concentrated spice. Drink now."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,92,36,"A serious, impressive wine, packed with the dark tannins of Touriga Nacional. It also has an elegance that gives it shape, structure and surprising poise for such a rich, juicy wine. The fruit is ripe, flavored with dark berries, cranberry tannins and some wood spice. Age for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,18,"Made from a collection of old varieties, with delicious ripe fruit, dark tannins and a powerful structure. The texture is surrounded by sweet fruit, super-rich plums, black figs, the exuberant fruit balanced by a more austere, serious side."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,32,"Many see the Touriga Nacional in the Dão as superior to the same grape in the Douro. As in this wine, it has power and richness, but with extra complexity, the fruit powered by dark tannins. The structure is solid, with a firm, spicy elegance."
Portugal,Castelão,Red,86,10,"Palmela is the region just south of Lisbon, producing light, fresh wines that are both great values and great everyday drinking. The strawberry fruit flavors are immediately appealing, freshened by the acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,10,"A ripe, soft wine that represents great drinking value. The fruit is fresh and easy, with light tannins and acidity. This is juicy, full of red fruits and touched by a light element of wood."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,85,11,"A soft, lightly sweet style of rosé, flavored with strawberries and a touch of caramel. Fresh, and flavorful, with balancing acidity, this is a good apéritif wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,60,"From old, mixed planting vineyards in the Quinta do Vallado, this is an impressively complex blend of flavors, from rich spice, smooth tannins, the richest plum juice and a gorgeous, opulent texture. It is ripe, drinkable now, but likely to benefit from several years aging."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,40,"An impressive wine that takes its name from the chalk and clay soils of the vineyards. It has acidity, sweet tarry characters, blackberries, cranberry juice and dense, dense tannins. The final burst of acidity sets the whole wine in context. Age for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,20,"A firm wine, with dark chocolate and coffee flavors. The fruit flavors are  dark fig and stewed plums; there is a bitter edge to the tannins."
Portugal,Alfrocheiro,Red,85,11,"Normally grown in the Dão region, this grape needs poor soil to flourish. On its own, it makes a powerfully fruity wine packed with red fruits and some flavors of dark chocolate. The acidity is intense, and needs another few months to settle down."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,9,"Crisp apples, touched with some sweetness, but finely clean and fresh, this is a great apéritif style of Vinho Verde, finishing with just a sparkle. Screwcap."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,93,40,"A blend of Chardonnay and Maria Gomes, here is a ripe wood- and apricot-flavored wine. It is full, spicy, livened by crispness from a red apple skin texture. The vanilla from the wood adds a delicious richness to this impressive wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,50,"A step up from the Follies range, this is a big and richly smooth black wine, its tannins well integrated into the great plum juice fruits. The wine is ripe, now ready to drink, the final blackberry acidity giving a bright boost."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,45,"Garrafeira in Portugal means a special selection, and this wine, from low yielding vines, has an impressive concentration. Its dark chocolate and mature spice flavors are just part of a powerfully fruity wine, all dark plum skins and sweet acidity. Ready to drink now, but could age."
Portugal,Encruzado,White,90,12,"Made from the Dão's very own white grape, this wine shows a fine balance between creamy, ripe yellow fruits, spice and a tense mineral streak. The new wood flavors give the wine a great richness and lift, a final roundness over the fresh fruits."
Portugal,Arinto,White,90,18,"A barrel-aged white, with crisp acidity made rich by spice and toast. The balance is just right, the stone yellow fruits giving ripe softness, while minerality and acidity provide the contrast."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,12,"A full wine, balanced with an attractive citrus character and some creamy texture. There is also an edge of tannin that makes it a good, fresh, food wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,67,"A concentrated wine, still just beginning its journey. The fruits are packed into a firm and tannic structure that shows edges of wood. Berry and plum fruits dominate this powerful but well-balanced wine. Keep for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,90,16,"Coming from the Alvarinho region of Monção in the far north of Portugal, this is a rich wine, its creamy apple character brought out beautifully by its tight, steely edge. This has style, ripe fruit, a green plum skin edge to it, finished with vibrant acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,90,12,"A blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura, this is relatively full-bodied Vinho Verde. The creamy texture is the most apparent, always freshened with lively citric acidity, a very light prickle on the mouth. The wine is fragrant and crisp. Drink this summer, but also possible to age."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,6,"A success in the sweeter Vinho Verde category. There is pleasant softness, flavors of green berries, grapefruit with sugar and freshness."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,92,13,"Alvarinho is the grape of northern Vinho Verde, giving a style that is rich and complex. The fruit here fits that character, packed with pear, apple and citrus flavors and a light texture of lime zest. Note: this wine is commercialized as Follies Alvarinho outside the U.S."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,15,"A blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz, with big, dusty tannins, ripe new wood and black, jammy fruit. The exuberance is held in check by minerality, but the final effect is of a ripe, satisfying wine, the spicy new wood showing strongly."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,19,"Escolha in Portuguese indicates an aged wine, and this solid, chunky red has obviously softened by wood and bottle aging. It has a velvet, warming texture, its black plum and berry fruits smoothing out the tannins. There is a great burst of juicy acidity to finish. Delicious to drink now, but worth aging."
Portugal,Alfrocheiro,Red,90,30,"There's plenty going on here, from the sweet tannins and strawberry flavors to the leathery, mature edge. The wine is so ripe, its structure keeping the generous fruit together, but allowing an almost opulent character to dominate."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,32,"A classic Portuguese blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Franca, this is a medium-bodied wine with good structure and presence of tannin. Bright fruit flavors of red currant, cherry and strawberry abound on the palate, finishing fresh and clean."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,25,"Still young, this is a complex wine. It has layers of dusty tannins, spiced fruits, ripe blackberries and a dark structure. Black chocolate and licorice feed extra richness into the wine. Very smooth aftertaste."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,92,18,"Continuing the succession of fine wines from Aveleda's Quinta da Agueira in Bairrada, this is a powerful, firmly tannic but ultimately smooth wine. It has big ripe swathes of dark plums, figs and refreshing sweet acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,26,"A firmly dry wine, driven by the dark tannins, only opening slowly to give ripe berry fruits. The soft side of the wine does bring out the lighter nature of the Baga in the blend, which has been tamed by wood aging. There is a final flourish of fresh black plum juice."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,90,34,"Made jointly by Filipa Pato and her husband William, a blend of Encruzado from Dão and Bical from Bairrada, and cask fermented. It is a beautiful wine, dense, concentrated, rich and creamy, a mouthfilling wine with white figs, and a green plum skin texture."
Portugal,Shiraz,Red,90,11,"Its dark color promises power, and this wine delivers a broad, chunky Shiraz, with perfumed fruit, dark tannins and a spicy wood structure. Solid concentration gives a wine that somehow manages to assimilate a Franco/Australian variety into a dry Portuguese structure."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,29,"You want big, bold flavors, plenty of spicy wood? It's all here inside the heavyweight bottle. In fact, the spice is the most dominant character, flavors of grated nutmeg going right over the dark, closed tannins and big, brooding fruit. Give it 2–3 years."
Portugal,Encruzado,White,90,20,"The Dão's very own white variety, Encruzado gives a citric, bright lime and grapefruit wine, with a delicious bite of pear skin. This is a fine example of the grape, rounded at the edges, with an outburst of fresh acidity, very fresh, but worth aging for 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,83,8,"An easy, fresh, slightly sparkling wine with pleasant, soft, lightly sweet fruit flavors. It is clean, a great apéritif for a summer's day."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,7,"On paper, this is an interesting blend of Aragonez and Cabernet; however, this fruity wine is much simpler than that. There is a spice element that adds some complexity, but the palate concentrates mainly on red fruits and layered acidity. Drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,12,"A soft, simple wine, the tannins set the pace, but the fruit doesn't quite follow. It is relatively light, with some red fruits and good acidity."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon,Red,91,13,"From the aroma, this seems heavily wooded, but on the palate the wood spice is becoming well integrated with the dark berry fruits and mineral texture. It is certainly young. Already, though, the fruit is showing its potential richness. Give it 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,90,"From old vines, on pre-phylloxera terraces, this is a powerful, concentrated wine. It is solid, packed with sweet rich fruits with an opulent texture. The acidity keeps the extravagance in check, but this is not a faint-hearted wine."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,91,13,"A broad style of wine, bringing in the richness of Alvarinho and the more crisp character of Loureiro. It is very much in Vinho Verde style, just with extra power to give a final creamy character."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,15,"From pure Touriga Nacional, this is already mature, with earthy overtones coming through to give leather aromas and flavors that are moving into spice, sweet wood and dark coffee. It has a great smooth texture with delicious final acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,10,"With its blend of Touriga Nacional, Castelão and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine successfully blends Portugal and France. There is already some maturity here, the wine soft, with red berries and a leather tannin character. Ready to drink now, with a final fresh acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,89,20,"A smooth, toasty wine, with distinct caramel and vanilla flavors, on top of ripe mangos and apricots. The Bical grape that dominates the blend gives a delicious creamy texture."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,17,"A blend of grapes from Filipa Pato's vineyards in Bairrada and Dão, very aromatic, with a smooth, silky texture. The wine shows ripeness, sweet berries and perfumed black currant, violets and licorice."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,89,11,"It is called Point West because Estremadura's vineyards are the furthest west in Europe. The wine itself is soft and fruity initially, but then there is a tight tannic texture, followed by black currant fruits. The wine is finely made, elegant, just on the warm side of cool."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,82,7,"Somewhat lean, this has a tart, grapefruit character that sits awkwardly with the otherwise fresh, green fruit character. Hard-edged."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,20,"A powerfully rich wine, packed with sweet plum juice and damson fruits. It has considerable density, its structure a firm edifice for the ripe fruits. Good aging potential here."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,16,"With plenty of weight, but weight that is concentrated around a tight, firm tannic core. The wine has great ripe plum and black cherry fruits, brimming from the glass. The acidity is a strong presence, and with the tannin promises several years' aging."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,35,"Broadened by spicy wood, this is a smooth, rich and opulent wine. It has sweet plum and black cherry flavors to go with its dense texture. There is a light sprinkling of pepper to go with the grated nutmeg and powerful core of tannins. For aging 5–6 years and more."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,24,"A smooth, well-integrated wine, showing sweet fruits, flavors of stewed red plums, with bright acidity. The proportions are all there, a wine that has style and freshness, as well as just the right fruit density."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,81,8,"The familiar rosé Lancers is all about crushed strawberries with a touch of sugar. There is a light structure, but the attractive light pink color and the fresh fruit all work together. Screwcap."
Portugal,Petit Verdot,Red,91,44,"It is rare to find a pure Petit Verdot (the grape used in some blends in Bordeaux) anywhere, let alone in Portugal. The Alentejo is a good place, with guaranteed ripeness for this fickle grape. Dark in color, packed with dense tannins and a heavy layer of wood, this is not for the faint-hearted. It is certainly ripe and rich."
Portugal,Syrah,Red,90,24,"A firmly structured wine, its tannins well bedded into perfumed black plum fruits. It has juicy, fresh acidity over the rich fruits, giving brightness to an otherwise weighty wine."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,90,9,"Now in a smart clear blue bottle, this is Aveleda's estate wine. It is always a classic, with just some extra weight to give it distinction. The flavors are apple, brightened with lime, finishing with vibrant acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,35,"Smooth, wood and black fig flavored wine, rich and velvet in texture. The wine initially seems ready to drink, but then tannins kick in and it is obviously a wine with good aging potential. Certainly the weight, power and ripe fruit are all very evident."
Portugal,Arinto,White,89,19,"A fine, elegant wood-aged wine. It has ripe fruits, sweet peach, apricot, mango, while the vanilla of toast lifts all the flavors, adding spicy smoothness. Acidity comes from fresh lime. It could do with some aging, maybe 2–3 years."
Portugal,Pinot Noir,Red,89,25,"An exotic blend including Pinot Noir and Merlot along with Portuguese varieties, taking its name from two local villages with saint's names. It has acidity and an awkward bitter edge, with tough black fruits. Maybe it needs time for the wine to soften and meld with the tight acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,15,"A densely dry wine, the tannins dominating the fruit. In style, it harks back to the more tannic offerings from the Dão, but with a more modern interpretation that brings in berry fruits and a final fresh, juicy character."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,11,"An elegant style, the ripe fruit restrained and kept in check by the dry tannins and acidity. The flavors start lightly, but then the wine gives a fine intensity and concentration as it opens up. The berry flavors are balanced by the dried fruits, with a new wood layer coming through to finish. Worth aging for 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,17,"The main estate wine from Quinta dos Roques, this offers mature fruit, with acidity, layers of black figs, chocolate and licorice, as well as red plum juice. It is finely structured, giving some elegance to go with its complex flavors."
Portugal,Port,Red,95,467,"Perfectly mature, this Port's tannins have softened over the past 40-plus years, leaving it lushly textured and displaying rich fig and chocolate flavors. Finishes long, picking up a touch of almond to go with the fig, flavors Symington calls “Dow's hallmarks.” Drink now–2015, longer if you prefer very mature wines."
Portugal,Port,Red,94,62,"A powerhouse of a wine that goes from densely rich to massive without a pause. The ripe fruit, the dark, heavy tannins, the black plum and fig flavors, all come from the terroir of this great vineyard."
Portugal,Port,Red,94,49,"In the Fonseca tradition, this is a hugely rich wine, very dense. It is not all weight, with excellently integrated firm tannins and a range of complex flavors, from nuts and berry fruits to full frontal ripeness. There is some dryness to finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,94,94,"Mouthfilling and round, without any sharp edges, but this wine remains extremely firm and dense, with several decades of life ahead of it. Dried fig, chocolate and black licorice flavors only hint at what lies ahead."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,83,7,"A soft, simple wine with flavors of green fruits, and a layer of tannins. Medium-bodied and floral, it has a soft, medium-sweet aftertaste. Imported by Tri-Vin Imports."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,11,"A bone-dry, slightly spritzy Vinho Verde, all sparkle and brightness. The crisp citrus and grapefruit character is fresh, vital and refreshing. This is what Vinho Verde is all about."
Portugal,Jaen,Red,88,26,"The Jaen, known in Bierzo, Spain as Mencia, gives freshly juicy wines, but with a definite edge of structure. This example has those characters, as well as concentration and ripeness. It is balanced, elegant, a great food wine."
Portugal,Baga,Red,88,11,"Bairrada's difficult grape, the Baga, needs time for aging, which is what has happened here. The result is a wine that is fragrant, not heavy, poised and fresh. The red berry fruits are lifted by acidity, there is a tell-tale Baga dry tannic core, but well in balance. A great food wine."
Portugal,Cabernet Sauvignon,Red,88,13,"A very Portuguese version of Cabernet Sauvignon, with sweet, jammy red berries and only light tannins. The fruit has freshness, but the dominant character is sweetness, ripeness, a wine full of final juicy acidity."
Portugal,Arinto,White,88,13,"Crisp, structured wine, showing the fruit skin and bite that makes Arinto such an interesting variety. There is an orange zest edge, emphasizing lightness, freshness, finishing a delicious wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,66,"As ever, Vesuvio is packed with its generous, opulent ripe fruit, showing richness, dense flavors, layers of jam and sweetness with a hint of caramel flavors. This is a Port for indulgence, ripe, rich and packed with flavor."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,83,"A powerhouse, but one that shows a certain degree of lushness to its robust blackberry and mint flavors. Finishes long and minerally, bolstered by slightly drying tannins. Should be more approachable by 2015 and last for three decades beyond that."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,50,"A finely structured, impressively elegant wine, packed with dark fruit skin flavors, heavy with tannins and delicious perfumed fruit. While it is rich, it is also dry, suggesting excellent aging potential."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,70,"Dense, dusty, structured, tannic, dry wine, that promises aging potential. It is definitely young, dark with plum skin fruits, power and richness, that go along with excellent acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,83,7,"A soft, gentle, honey-and-spice wine that gives immediate pleasure as an apéritif. There is just a touch of acidity to keep it all in balance. Imported by Admiral Wine Imports."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,13,"Big and rich, this is a round and structured wine. It has great layers of ripe herbs, full black fruits and exotic spice to go over the dry tannins. The final flavors are rich, tarry, juicy as well as powerful."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,13,"Blending Alvarinho and Trajadura, oenologist Anselmo Mendes has created a deliciously creamy but dry style of Vinho Verde. The citrus character is there, but the texture is open, just hints of apple skins over the apricots and white peaches."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,30,"A blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon, with Touriga Nacional, to give a tight wine, solid, taking its austerity from the 2006 vintage. The berry fruits offer structure, and allow the wine to finish with a fresh note."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,90,"Approachable now, but capable of further positive evolution, the 1980 is lush and supple, with abundant chocolate and dried-spice flavors and a long, warming finish. Drink now–2025."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,80,"A rounded, ripe, sweet wine, touched with caramel and dry figs. There's generous, rich fruit, and a feeling of warmth from spice and dark plums. Ripe, leavened with acidity for aging."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,75,"Vineyards don't get more remote than Ervamoira, in the heart of the Côa national park of prehistoric wall drawings. It's dry here, and that's evident from the dusty tannins, firm dark black fruits, and considerable aging potential."
Portugal,Castelão,Red,90,14,"Just turning in color, a wine that is beginning to mature. It has leathery texture over spice, ripe tannins and flavors of red fruit jelly. There is a bitter coffee character that melds easily into the tannins. It is a delicious wine, balanced and made for food."
Portugal,Fernão Pires,White,88,10,"A full, weighty, fat wine, almost new world Chardonnay in its texture and richness. It does come back to its roots, though, with the fresh melon and pear flavors in front of a definite mineral background. A food white, for good fish dishes, perhaps with spice."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,9,"The lovely spritz of fresh Vinho Verde bubbles out of the glass of this lively, crisp and citrus-flavored wine. It has the right edge of fruit skins giving structure to the summer fruits and acidity."
Portugal,Malvasia Fina,White,88,15,"From a 73-acre vineyard, owned by Quinta dos Roques, on the slopes of the Serra de Estrella, Portugal's highest mountains. With 10% wood aging, this is has a light vanilla touch, but that is quickly mixed with the ripe lemon and honey, peach and cantaloup melon flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,17,"A ripe and smooth wine, flavored with pears, white peach and spiced with gentle new wood. The touch of minerality comes from the chalk soils of the vineyards. The finish, though, comes back to smoothness, with an edge of acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,50,"Soft in texture yet mouthcoating in its intensity, this is a honeyed, nutty wine filled with dried fruit, toffee and almond butter aromas and flavors. Like all tawnies, it won't improve with bottle age, so drink this while your young vintage Ports hog the cellar space."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,45,"A dry, structured wine, firm and with tannic, concentrated fruit. Spirit and acidity are both evident, but with its dark, brooding style this is an impressive return to form by Croft."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,10,"A fine, ripe wine, with big, bold tannins, solid fruit and a structured black juice character. It is definitely rich in texture, but at the same time has a tight, mineral edge and restraint."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,15,"A ripe, full-bodied wine, the yellow peach and apricot flavors balanced with grapefruit, spice and a pear skin structure. There is a hint of vanilla from the wood, with a final, enticing floral character."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,52,"Soft, perfumed wine, with a rich, full-bodied style that goes towards dry. At this stage, the spirit is somewhat obvious, but that is a sign of youth, and the wine will develop power and strength over the next several years."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,47,"This is a superlative vineyard, and this wine shows its true character, a big, hearty wine, but one with a structured core of mineral, rich fruits and dark tannins. With its concentration, expect it to age well over 10 years and more."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,50,"Structured, complex wine that is only just beginning to hint at considerable depth of powerful, rich flavors. The structure is dry, a little lean, but with dense tannins. The fruit, rich plums and stone fruits is just coming through. Age for 10 years."
Portugal,Cabernet Sauvignon,Red,89,10,"The 15th century Quinta de Pancas, north of Lisbon, produces this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon wine. It has initially lean tannins, but the fruit has spice, black currant fruits and a tight line in wood and final sweetness. For aging."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,6,"A big dense wine, as tough as the rocks that make up the Dão soil. Its fruit is certainly there, a welter of black berries and plums. But in this young wine, the tannins are still in charge. This is going to develop, opening up, becoming less mineral, over the next three years."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,60,"A classic, structured, well-shaped Port with its attractive dry tannins and firm, dark berry fruit. There's excellent balance between the fruit and the sweet spirit character, which goes right through this serious wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,14,"The high vineyards of inland eastern Portugal gives a wine that is initially austere, tasting very much of its rock terroir, cool and elegant. The fruit is very direct, fresh and juicy, with the tannins a strong presence. The final acidity is a cool burst."
Portugal,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Red,87,38,"Literally meaning “Bordeaux soup,” this is a blend of Bordeaux varieties, including 25% Petit Verdot. It is big and powerful, with a hugely deep color, solid tannins and sweet acidity. Great juicy wafts come through the dark tannins."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,6,"Pear and creamy apples round out a soft, fruity wine. The Arinto grapes give a plum skin tightness to the structure, but the main character is of a full, ripe but also fresh wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,95,46,"The legendary Mouchão, one of Portugal's most revered wines, has finally made it to this country. Made in traditional open stone fermenters, this is not a modern wine. It's a wine, whose dark tannins and dense fruits demand attention and time. At this stage—six years in—it remains a baby, but in another five years, it will start to be a great wine, one that will show a hedonistic mix of power and beauty."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,19,"This is the greatest of the quintas planted by Dona Antonia Ferreira in the 19th century. It is in the Douro Superior, the driest, most remote part of the Douro. The Olazabal family, descendants of Dona Antonia, produce this hugely impressive, dark-hued wine, packed with dense, brooding tannins and solid, initially tough fruits, which open out to opulence and richness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,150,"Dark, dense and concentrated, with power and elegance. But somehow this complex wine also shows restraint and style. It has much to do with the pure richness of the fruit (from 90-year-old vines) as the acidity which lifts and restrains the power."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,17,"A densely fruity wine, with berry and plum fruits, pushed by some firm tannins. It is the ripe fruit, brimming over the glass, that makes this wine so delicious and approachable now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,15,"Velvet-textured wine, smoothed by wood aging, the black fruits pushing through the layer of dusty tannins. It has a feeling of power and concentration. It could well age another 2–3 years or more. A step up over previous vintages."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,12,"Floral, fresh aromas burst out of the glass in this green, crisp wine. There is a creamy element to it, probably from the Alvarinho in the blend, giving the wine some richness. But in the end, this is all about lightness, summer drinking with seafood."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,54,"Fruity, lacking the power of some vintages of Vargellas, but more than making up with richness, sweetness and delicious violet perfumes. There is some cranberry jelly flavor, an edge of dryness and firmness in the fruit, but it's more about ripeness."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,57,"From a vineyard opposite Quinta do Vesuvio, high up the Douro, this Symington-owned property has produced a rich, sweet 2004, with a soft tannic structure, layered with a lightly spirit edge. It's a big mouthful of ripe fruit."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,70,"The top wine in the Quinta do Portal range is in its second vintage. With 12 months aging in French oak, the power is all there in very dark, heavy tannins that dominate the fruit. This is a powerful expression of the richness and the structure of great Douro wines, all granite and mineral in character, dark and tough, sure to age well."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,56,"The joint venture between the Cazes family of Bordeaux and the Roquette family of Quinta do Crasto in the Douro is in its second released vintage. This is made using Bordeaux techniques, resulting in a style that is more structured than many Douro wines, exploiting ripe fruit with solid tannins, leavened by sweetness and sweet red fruits. The wood shows through on the finish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,29,"A hugely juicy wine, dominated by Touriga Nacional, leavened by dry tannins. It's big, ripe, with vivid red fruits giving spice and power. Immediately attractive now, it is likely to age well over the next 5–8 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,50,"An impressively powerful wine, with concentrated fruit from old vines. It packs dense tannins, layers flavors of ripe figs, plums and raisins, along with wood flavors. The quinta is close to Regua in the western part of the Douro vineyards, a region particularly well suited to powerful but still elegant table wines."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,88,60,"This is a big wine, going on sweet and superripe. It is almost heavy, the acidity a necessary foil to the dense matter here. Sweet and perfumed berry fruits are dominant along with spice from new wood."
Portugal,Syrah,Red,87,17,"There are few Syrahs in Portugal—some in the Alentejo—but this comes from the coastal region of Bairrada. It shows all the rich, violet and black plum juice varietal character, very juicy. There is spice from wood, but this and the soft tannins meld easily into the rich fruit."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,29,"This estate, managed by the Symington family, is a great Douro property by any standard. This hot 2003 vintage is properly big and dense, but the elegance and style of the estate shows through, with delicious ripe plum flavors over the new wood. Age this for at least 6 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,125,"From a single vineyard at Quinta do Crasto, this wine was fermented in open lagars. It is big, perfumed, packed with superripe fruit. It could almost be too much, but the spice, pepper and dense tannins are restrained by an edge of acidity. It promises long-term aging."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,13,"Moscatel dominates the blend of this wine and gives a perfumed character. It has some good weight and freshness, a bright green plum and pear flavor. The acidity and ripe fruit are well in balance."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,22,"Already showing good balance between ripe wood and plum and blackberry fruits, this is a full wine. The acidity is a welcome layer of juicy freshness in the rich texture. Drink now and over the next 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,11,"Ripe, soft and fruity, with dense sweet fruit. The wine is approachable, an enticing mix of tannins, spice and coffee. With its fruity finish, the wine is sure to please. The quinta was owned by the local postman, and correio is the word for post in Portuguese."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,49,"The name refers to the big meander the Douro river takes around the quinta's vineyards, forming a long peninsula. Like its big brother, the quinta wine, this reflects the heat and the concentrated fruit that comes from this famed vineyard. Its tannins are almost impenetrable at this stage, deep and dry, needing several years of aging to reveal the solid, ripe dark, spicy flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,54,"The darkest, most impressive version of the Duas Quintas brand, this Reserva is made in the open lagars, from foot-trodden grapes in the tradition still used by major Port houses. It gives a ripe, sweet, almost Port-like character, but still firmed by structure and dusty tannins to go with the superripe plums."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,11,"A fresh, ripe red wine, with spice and sweet fruit. There is a simple, attractive juicy character, accompanied by soft tannins. The fruit is fresh and berry-flavored, just brushed by wood."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,97,"A good choice for current consumption, the 1985 Dow's shows a touch of bricking to go along with developed aromas of cedar, clove and cinnamon. Cherry, plum, fennel and dried spice notes finish with a hint of toffee. Drink now–2015."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,100,"The fine, ripe, structured character of Touriga Nacional is well evident here. It may be big in alcohol, but the wine wears that easily, going more for fresh tannins and acidity, for black currant and dark plum flavors and smooth, vanilla flavors from the French wood aging."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,17,"Structured, rich, but also with good fresh acidity, this is one of the best wines in the Quinta do Portal range. It has lively, vibrant red fruit, along with dry tannins, some vanilla from wood aging. Great acidity in the aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,23,"From Aliança's Alentejo Terrugem vineyard, this dense, tannin-packed wine has powerful flavors of dark fruits, a very dry backbone and layer upon layer of tarry, smoky tastes. Initially it overwhelms with its richness, but that softens and the acidity gives the wine a lifted vibrancy."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,14,"There is an earthy aroma to this wine along with a rustic edge. There is also spice from minty wood, a dry core of tannins, with acidity that seems too prominent. All these characters suggest a wine that needs some aging over the next 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Sparkling,White,87,14,"Lovers of Moscato sparkling wines will enjoy this with its poise between sweetness and acidity. It is very fragrant, very refreshing, the sweetness never cloying."
Portugal,Fernão Pires,White,86,9,"Full, soft wine, with fruit that is rich and gentle. The acidity is what keeps this broad wine together. The green apple and white berry fruits add texture, with just a touch of spice."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,80,"Soft, superripe wine, with layers of sweet black figs and chocolate. This is almost like a Porty Zinfandel in its richness. There are tannins there, but they seem lost in this riot of sweet fruit."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,55,"On the outside this is all soft, generous round fruit. In the core, though, there is a strong acid, perfumed fruit character, which suggests aging potential. Now the two components need to come together."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,60,"The Quinta da Leda is high up the Douro, in the remote regions of Douro Superior. This 2004 shows the concentration of the fruit in the dark tannins, the toasty new wood and the ripe dark plum fruits. It is smooth enough to drink now, but the tannins promise 5–6 years aging."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,40,"Old vines in this case means 70-year-old vines. Featuring blackberry fruit flavors, along with plums, sweet and rich, this shows a dense, herbal character, dry tannins, lifted by acidity to finish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,25,"A rare Portuguese Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend, made with the involvement of Bordeaux winemaker Pascal Chatonnet, working with Caves Aliança's winemaker Francisco Antunes. Does it work? Yes, as a delicious curiosity. There is no connection with Portugal, but there is smooth new wood, and some pepper from alcohol.

Portugal,Tinta Roriz,Red,86,8,"TR stands for Tinta Roriz, the dominant grape in this blended wine (with Touriga Nacional). It is smooth, polished, with a spice and mint character, juicy and fruity. The tannins may be dry, but they in no way inhibit the exuberant fruit."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,5,"They say red Vinho Verde is an acquired taste, and with its very tight tannins and acidity, this wine fits the billing. Think of it with sardines or fatty meats."

Portugal,Port,Red,96,95,"Dense and serious, a powerful vintage, as would be expected from Fonseca. The whole emphasis of the wine pushes the tannins forward, but this structure is based on black plums with dark fruit skins and a solid, chunky character. The finish is juicy and bold."
Portugal,Port,Red,96,230,"A serious, impressive wine produced from a small parcel of old vines at Vargellas.

It is tight, solid and certainly for aging."
Portugal,Port,Red,95,125,"From a parcel of old vines around the quinta chapel, this is a stunning wine. It has all the opulence we expect from Vesuvio, along with a density that is rare in this vintage. The tannins are there, but are equalled by the toffee, ripe fruit, figs, sweet chocolate. The whole wine is lightened by acidity, but will obviously age."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,23,"His skills show in this rich, powerful, finely balanced wine. It has layers of black berry fruits, damsons, bitter chocolate and a good core of acidity. Give this impressive wine 3–4 years."
Portugal,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Red,94,49,"A selection from the Quinta da Bacalhôa vineyard, this sumptuous wine layers the darkest fruit flavors with a structure that is solid, dense and powerful.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,38,"Rui Reguinga, named Portugal's Winemaker of the Year in 2009, produces this sumptuous wine. The fruit is rich, with jammy berries and plums, balanced with spice from wood aging. The core of tannins suggests a powerful wine that will age well."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,5,"They say red Vinho Verde is an acquired taste, and with its very tight tannins and acidity, this wine fits the billing. Think of it with sardines or fatty meats."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,23,"An elegant wine, its acidity showing through balanced black berry fruits. The wine has good spice along with a dry core of light tannins."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,82,5,"A sweet, soft, clean wine, anonymous almost. Yes, there is freshness, lightness, but all the time the awkward, unbalancing sweetness pulls it down. Drink very chilled."

Big, black, brooding fruits are complemented by superripe acidity, bitter chocolate and a firm aftertaste. Age for 4–5 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,67,"Dark in color, as befits a wine that was food trodden in open fermenters. To say it has a Port-like feel is to emphasize the wine's concentration, the mellifluous tannins and the powerful black fruits. It needs several years aging."
Portugal,Loureiro,White,92,25,"This is a rarity —wood-aged Vinho Verde. It works beautifully, the floral flavors of the Loureiro grape balanced with a smooth texture. The green fruit flavors dominate, just broadened by the wood."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,100,"Although 2008 was not a general vintage, some estates have released vintage Ports. Noval's Vintage, just bottled at the time of tasting, is a delicate and perfumed wine, elegant rather than powerful, with delicious black berry fruits to go with the rich core of sweet tannins."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,11,"With an initial smooth texture, this is a rich wine. The ripe fruit hides the firm, dense structure, packed with dry tannins and wood spice. The wine is powerful in a serious way, needing several years' aging."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,91,12,"Rich, smooth, with great wafts of creaminess to go with a judicious amount of toast. White plum and pear flavors precede a finish with impressive concentration and delicious acidity."

Aged for a year in French wood, it shows elegance, laden with spice, new wood and fruit tannins that open slowly over dense red berry fruits. Worth aging."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,30,"A light wine from a wet year. The wine is soft, seemingly dilute. It has some red berry flavors, but not much texture or structure, with wood aging taste."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,49,"A firm, initially austere wine that only shows its richness slowly. Obviously it needs aging, because the dark tannins show the huge potential concentration of fruit under the tigth structure. It's going to be impressive. Give it 5–6 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,47,"A new label for the top wine from Comporta, producing a big, rich, muscular wine. It has powerful tannins, a solid and firm structure and ripe berry and plum fruits. The tannins need 2–3 years to round out."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,92,25,"An oak-aged wine that is velvet textured, the acidity a fresh addition to the rich, opulent fruit. Full in the mouth, it is flavored with ripe lime juice and mango. The aftertaste is rich, spicy and delicious."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,13,"An elegant red, with power, acidity and black berry flavors curling around a structured core of dark tannins. This is cool Touriga, very poised, worth aging for two years, with a delicious spicy aftertaste."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,50,"You can tell this is intended as an important wine by the extravagant weight of the bottle. Put that environmental disaster to one side, and you find inside an impressive wine, crafted by Frenchman Pascal Chatonnet and Aliança's winemaker Francisco Antunes. The fruit power is balanced by wood, acidity, spice and sweet tannins. The wine rolls satisfyingly around the mouth now, but would be worth aging."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,25,"With two years of barrel and bottle aging, this wine is maturing attractively. The tannins remain firm, but the taste is broad, rich, a fine combination of solid black plums and wood spice, with a tight edge of acidity. Big, with bold brush strokes of flavor, but worth aging another two years."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,15,"Lean and light in character, a wine that shows a very stalky style, the acidity and tannins dominant."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,70,"An impressive, serious wine that shows great ripe fruits, concentrated tannins and a solid edge of wood aging. It is finely structured, its richness not taking away from its balance, although it certainly is no wimp. Enjoy with hearty meals."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional Blend,Red,90,25,"There was once a belief that Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional were related, although DNA tests have now disproved it. Putting the two together gives a big, smooth wine, the tannins of the Touriga rounded and softened by the hearty Pinot Noir red fruits."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,50,"The second vintage from this spectacularly restored estate in the upper Douro shows greater intensity, the fruits concentrated, ripe, full of bright berries. It has plenty of richness, maybe not hugely complex, but likely to develop well over 2–5 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,20,"Sweet, soft and rich, with vanilla flavors along with fresh blackberry fruits. The wine is gentle, missing tannins, but immediately appealing, with its indulgent ripe fruit."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,50,"This looks and tastes young for its age, sweet and caramel in flavor, the wood element missing. It's almost syrupy in its texture, a full-bodied style, with fresh black fruits still there."
Portugal,Loureiro,White,90,15,"The Loureiro is the grape of the Lima Valley subregion in Vinho Verde. The texture of the wine is rounded and creamy, although the crisp green fruits give a great bright lift to this delicious, fresh wine."

Portugal,Port,Red,87,19,"Concentrated and dry, this shows good blackberry fruits to go along with the firm, dark tannins and ripe, juicy flavors. The fruit is rich, but not overtly sweet, more juiciness and acidity to go with the balancing spirit."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,16,"Relatively dry, this has some firm tannins, darkened by plum skin flavors and ripe berries, lifted with acidity. The spirit element comes through as pepper and spice, giving an edge to the soft fruit."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,135,"It has a medicinal character along with flavors of syrup and wood. It is concentrated, almost too concentrated, very intense, to be drunk by the drop rather than the glass."

Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,7,"A darkly tannic wine, very mineral, tasting of the granite Dão soil. The wine is taut, fresh with black currants, its structure a major element. For aging 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,10,"Classic tannic Dão Touriga Nacional, packed with minerality, dark and dry tannins, firm and with a good juicy final character. Part of a range of wines from across the country under the name Azul Portugal."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,44,"There is dense chocolate and sweet berry flavors in this still young wine, its complex density still working its way through the solid fruit flavors and richness. It is powerful, yet still elegant."
Portugal,Alicante Bouschet,Red,90,13,"Almost black in color, this is a concentrated powerhouse of black plum, damsons and dark berry fruits. It is explosively rich and densely structured, with intense juicy fruit."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,16,"On the Atlantic coast, south of Lisbon, the Herdade da Comporta style is rich, soft wines, generous in their warm tannins. The 2007 shows ripe fruit, figs, chocolate and plum flavors and dense texture."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,35,"Keeping some freshness, but showing signs of dryness, this is a well-aged 10-year old, the wood acidity and spirit dominating the fruit. The aftertaste shows considerable age—more than 10 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,90,"Both the high alcohol and the heavy bottle detract from what is a rich but balanced wine. It shows great concentration, dense texture, a powerful statement of the ripe fruit of the Alentejo. It's hard to seeing it aging much more than two years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,19,"The structure is the thing here, a square, firmly tannic wine. The dry core of this impressive wine spreads out to the dark plum skin and loganberry flavors, solid and finely angled."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,90,17,"From the far north of the Vinho Verde region, the rich and creamy wine balances acidity, green plum and crisp minerality. Aromatic, elegant, fresh."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,48,"A great, concentrated wine, rich, with a burnt almond character and delicious acidity. It keeps some freshness while showing a fine sense of maturity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,90,24,"The Bacalhôa quinta is more famed for its Cabernet-based red. Here Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc continue the Bordeaux connection. A superrich wine, although the creamy, full texture is beautifully balanced with a good layer of citrus. Full-bodied, stylish."
Portugal,Alfrocheiro,Red,90,13,"Powerful, concentrated wine, whose tannins fold well around the berry fruits, acidity and sweet plum juice flavors. It is solid and chunky, full of ripe flavors and bold acidity. Worth aging for 1–2 years."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,18,"Smooth-textured Port, with sweet red fruits under the brown sugar, nut and spirit flavors. This is certainly on the sweet side, with a velvet feel to it."
Portugal,Syrah,Red,89,30,"A step up from the 2006 vintage, rich and smooth, very perfumed. The tannins are soft, balancing well with the acidity, layer of wood spice and the ebullient red berry fruits."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,89,25,"Wood-aged wine, very rich and opulent. It has great layers of spice, guava, sweet nectarine, along with a light citrus touch. It feels high in alcohol, which is a shame."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,32,"While it does have some proper nutty characteristics, this is very much in the fresh, fruity style of 10-year old tawny. The currant flavors are light, with only hints of spirit and with some dark plum fruits."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,15,"A medium-sweet, cinnamon-flavored wine, with some yeast, spice and fresh white fruit flavors. An attractive, simple wine to be drunk by itself."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,15,"Smooth and silky, ripe stone fruit flavors are complemented by a flexible structure that gives shape to the juicy character. A light edge of wood and fine acidity complete the balance."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,45,"Chewy tannins presage a firm, ageworthy wine. At this stage, it is all bitter chocolate and extraction, the fruit not evident. Dark, brooding, feeling heavy, this needs many years for the tannins to soften."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,32,"Powerful and rich, this wine dominates with its concentrated dusty tannins. It shows big sweet black currant and plum fruits, with dark tannins offset with a layer of fresh acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,41,"A fine balance between the nuttiness of aged tawny and ripe sweet fruit makes an attractive, mellow yet tangy wine. The sweetness is given liveliness by the final acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,89,10,"Beautifully fresh wine that also has some weight to it. It is strung on a tightrope of crispness, balanced between white fruits and citrus. There is a great final mineral texture from the granite soils of the Minho."
Portugal,Shiraz,Red,89,13,"A big textured, smooth wine, sweet fruits with firm tannins finished with dark perfumes. It is a blockbuster, thankfully without high alcohol, balanced in its richness. A barbecue wine, ready to drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,19,"A curious blend of local grapes with Syrah and Merlot has produced a bold, ripe wine. The tannins are soft, surrounded by juicy plum and damson flavors and a broad, ripe texture."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,13,"Winemaker José Neiva delights in unusual blends such as this particular combination which should be tried more often. It is a big rich wine, packed with ripe flavors, plums, dark chocolate, rich sweet berries and firm tannins."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,89,12,"A ripe wine, with white fruits and a touch of spice. The crisp minerality of Vinho Verde is all there, with a satisfyingly textured aftertaste."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,16,"With aromas of white currants and white figs, this Port has a strong, almond flavor with an edge of bitterness. There is considerable acidity, but the nuts tell the tale."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,89,7,"A fine balance between yellow fruit richness, with apricots and peaches, and a crisp, exquisite line of citrus. The wine is rich, while also fresh, a great food white wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,18,"A bright, berry-flavored wine, acidity showing well against the firm, dry tannins. It has freshness from juicy fruit, with a lingering, vivid aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,14,"Balanced fresh wine, full of mango, guava and pineapple flavors. It has freshness, brightness, along with a refreshing citrus burst."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,27,"This wine is certainly a powerful statement: smooth, super-rich, tarry black berry fruits, spice and a sizable serving of wood vanilla. A wine to admire, not to enjoy."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,12,"Light, fresh, with some caramel and dried fruit flavors. This is a lightweight tawny, going more for freshness, with touches of raisins to finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,11,"Blackberry jam aromas, fresh, ripe jammy fruits, backed with sweet jelly and only lightly touched by spirit. A sweet, soft style, very easy."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,30,"Youthful wine, full of rich berry and black plum flavors. It is concentrated while bursting with exuberant fruits, balanced with acidity. This is a true second wine of Malhadinha Nova, ready to drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,14,"Lean and taut tannins play with the sweet spice of this concentrated wine. It has a dry, dark core, edged with acidity, followed by fresh red-berry flavors. The final juiciness—even after five years—is considerable."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional Blend,Red,88,13,"An attractive, fresh wine, the tannins and bright acidity giving a firm support to the lively berry fruits and dry tannin core. The aftertaste continues freshness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,24,"Firmly tannic, solid and dry wine, its balanced fruit fits well with acidity, spicy wood and a dense core of dry structure. Developing well, but age for 2–3 years."
Portugal,Castelão,Red,88,12,"Cranberry and mulberry fruits, sweet and soft and just so juicy. This is a lively wine with hints of rose hip and the freshest fruit—even after three years. The aftertaste is soft, hinting at wood."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,19,"This is a ruby reserve, bright red/black in color, with youthful fruity freshness. There are black fruits, with an edge of stalkiness, but ripely sweet at the same time. The aftertaste reveals good balancing acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,7,"A lively crisp wine, flavored with soft pear, green plum oregano, streaked through with vibrant acidity. It's light, fresh, ready to drink."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,10,"A spicy, berry-dominated wine, rustic edging to dusty tannins and a strong mineral character. There is a strong acid element giving great freshness to this fine value wine."
Portugal,Sauvignon Blanc,White,88,15,"From Sauvignon Blanc grown in the vineyards of the Mateus palace, this is a classic, herbaceous wine with attractive fresh and grassy acidity. The high altitude fruit is bright and crisp."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,11,"A powerful blend of Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Aragonez, rich and mellow, sweet fruits tempered by tight tannins and spice. The wine has a fine, juicy aftertaste to enhance the freshness."
Portugal,Port,Red,82,20,"Attractive fresh apple aromas are then spoilt by a rather hard, tart character. The spirit is obvious here, giving an uncomfortable edge."
Portugal,Port,Red,82,23,"A curious aroma of honeysuckle and tomatoes spoils this wine. The texture itself is fine, but it seems to have unripe fruit, very dry and rather lean. It could age, but the starting point doesn't seem promising."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,13,"Here in the maritime climate north of Lisbon, Alfrocheiro works well to produce a rich, smooth and velvet textured wine, with a beautiful layer of acidity over the wood."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,16,"A firmly structured blend of Castelão and Merlot, rich and dense in texture. Spice, red berry fruits and plums mingle with good fresh acidity in an attractive, sturdy wine."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,12,"Fragrant and fresh, this is a great bright, crisp Vinho Verde. The acidity is intense, balanced with an elegant softer texture. It just cries out for seafood."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,12,"This estate is right in the south of the Vinho Verde. That gives the wine extra weight, with added richness from the Avesso grape. The aftertaste brings in crispness."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,13,"This single vineyard Vinho Verde is complex and powerful. The texture is creamy, rich, with hints of pineapple as well as grapefruit. There is an edgy texture, balanced with the crispest final acidity."
Portugal,Chardonnay,White,88,20,"Ripe, fruity Chardonnay, with toast flavors balancing with smooth apricot and pear juice. The wine is soft, rich and generous, finishing with a light acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,7,"Big, ripe and spicy, with tobacco and herbal flavors alongside the black currant intensity and powerful acidity. It is rich while the austere tannins of the Baga grape are still young. Keep for 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,25,"A full, rather indistinct wine that shows plums and damson flavors under a layer of tough tannins. The sweeter fruit flavors come through slowly, and the pepper alcohol edge never goes away."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,18,"This is a big, spicy wine, its dark berry fruits balanced with ginger, acidity and wood. It has power and good concentration, leaving a rich, jammy aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,11,"Ripe and juicy, maybe a little rustic round the edges, certainly fruity. Red berry flavors dominate along with an edgy center of tannin, while juicy acidity completes this attractive wine."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,12,"From 100% Azal grapes, this is a rich style of Vinho Verde, ripe and citric, touched by minerality. Yeasty aromas go through the palate but don't detract from the ripe final fruit."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,14,"Raspberry, red cherries and fresh fruit come together with bright acidity and a soft, full texture. There is a good stalky, tannic core to give structure. A great barbecue wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,35,"A properly fruity 10-year-old tawny, balancing ripe fruit against fine, nutty character. It is fresh, on the sweet side, keeping a good layer of acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,20,"A soft and rich wine, lined with fresh pear, bitter almonds, fresh herbs and a glint of citrus. It is full bodied, while remaining fresh."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,11,"This rich, delicious blend of Castelão and Alicante Bouschet is soft and juicy, with black and blue berry flavors, dusty tannins and a fine, jammy aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,9,"A ripe, full-bodied and spicy wine, defiantly dry, with a tight acid character. Aromatic fruit finish with intense perfumes, so that the wine is both rich and fresh."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,27,"Celebrating the first lot—Port—in the first auction held by Michael Broadbent in 1966, this is a reserve style wine, rich and soft with chocolate and ripe berry flavors to go with the sweet texture. There is just a final edge of stalkiness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,18,"Big, chunky and ripe, with earthy aromas followed by soft, round texture. Spice and black berry fruit juice are supported by dry tannins. It is bold, a little rough around the edges."
Portugal,Fernão Pires,White,87,22,"Fresh and fruity, laced with citrus, crisp apricot and a delicious layer of lime juice. Drink now, but the wine will age a year."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,86,18,"Crisp, bright, strawberry-flavored wine that has some weight and spice to it. It shows ripe fruit as well as vivid acidity, freshly balanced with red currant aftertaste."
Portugal,Castelão,Red,86,10,"Soft, fruity wine from the Castelão grape grown in sandy vineyards, this is smooth and ripe, with a good edge of acidity. The wine has great berry fruits, just a touch of tannin, ready to drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,9,"Smooth, red-fruited wine with a fine balance between fresh berry acidity and ripe tannins. The wine is young, fresh, ready to drink."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,7,"Soft and creamy, although with just the right Vinho Verde bite, this is a crisp and clean wine, boasting light pear and pink grapefruit flavors. Off dry and very fresh."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,9,"Elegant, fresh wine, full of delicious red berry fruits, a fruit salad of red and black plums and a light touch of spice. Bright, juicy, ready to drink."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,86,15,"Delicious fresh citrus flavored wine, bright as a button, lively and crisp. Made from Alvarinho, there is a creamy texture with a mineral element, finishing with green plums and banana flavors."
Portugal,Cabernet Sauvignon and Tinta Roriz,Red,86,8,"An elegant wine, the tannins a core element in the firm structure. Acidity and black currant flavors go together with spice. It is a young wine, ready to drink, but will develop."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,13,"Juicy, elegant fruit is supported by firm tannins and a vivid texture. Refreshing acidity from black currant flavors, structured by wood and spice, finishing bright and fresh."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,17,"Rich and full-bodied, this white has almond, peach and mango flavors. In the mouth, it feels rich and concentrated, the acidity slow to reveal itself."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,9,"Light, fresh and crisp, typical of bright cool whites of the Lisbon region. It has lively, fresh acidity, picked out with lemon and grapefruit flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,19,"Fresh berry fruits, with stalky tannins and a fine juicy acidity give an easy, soft and ripe wine. Short wood aging has softened the bursting fruit and added a light touch of spice."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,11,"A rounded wine, keeping the white fruit character of pears, given vibrancy by a citric grapefruit flavor. Full in the mouth, it has a smooth texture, finishing softly."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,10,"Spicy wine, with Moscatel giving an attractive lychee edge to the fresh apple skins and citrus. Lively final acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,11,"A soft, juicy wine, one-dimensional but attractive in its strawberry fruits. There are pleasant tannins to give just enough weight."
Portugal,Castelão,Red,85,8,"Attractive spicy wine from Setúbal region's signature grape. Ginger, berries and light wood work well together to give richness without weight."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,10,"Earthy, spicy aromas are followed by a chunky wine, tasting of tough clay and limestone soils. Dark black currant fruits and layers of acidity, give an austere final flavor."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,10,"Attractive fruits with a good, juicy flavor characterize this easy, fresh wine. Black berry flavors and vivid acidity make it ready to drink now."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,12,"A sweet style of white Port, its nut and honey flavors dominant. It has good balance though, a delicious apéritif wine."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,85,10,"The Vinho Verde rosé style takes advantage of the high acidity of the red grapes in the region. Casa do Valle's rosé is bone dry, with an intense level of acidity, raspberry juice, crisp and fresh."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,85,7,"Fresh and fruity, with attractive pink coloring, this light rosé has raspberry flavors, a touch of sweetness and caramel. It finishes bright and crisp."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,90,"The estate wine of Malhadinha Nova is a serious proposition. With its firm, restrained tannins and dark, complex fruits, the latest vintage from this star estate is a wine for aging. It is powerful, but doe not lose its inspired elegance."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,40,"A beautifully shaped and structured wine. Its polished wood shines through the black plums, figs and dark chocolate flavors. It's a wine with a velvet texture, hiding sweet tannins and pushing the ripe fruit forward. For aging, 4–5 years, but already very drinkable."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,65,"Chryseia is a benchmark wine in modern Douro table wine making. With its layered tannins, black currant fruit, minerality and stylish yet powerful structure, this is a wine of great stature, needing aging for 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,200,"Named after Doña Antónia Adelaide Ferreira, who created Quinta do Vallado (and many other quintas) in the 19th century, this complex wine comes from a 100-year-old vineyard. Its concentration is immense, tannins solid, but at the same time the black cherry and dark plum flavors float over everything, leaving richness but also freshness. Worth aging for five years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,14,"Spicy fresh berry fruit, with a great burst of ripe plum juice, along with acidity. This is rich, although easy and medium-bodied. Drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,14,"A wine that starts almost too soft, the structure only slowly coming through. The fruit is pleasant, wood and bitter chocolate, tobacco and spice, but the wine lacks definition."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,7,"A medium-dry Vinho Verde, this is light and fresh without being quite crisp enough. Well chilled, though, it makes a lively and fresh apéritif."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,22,"Tasting young, with a stalky edge, this reserve Port shows black fruits, very berry in character. It is structured, on the dry side."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,50,"With its dark color and intense tannins, this is a big wine in all senses. The fruit is packed into a box of firm dry structure, with acidity keeping a lid on its potential exuberance. It certainly needs time for the richness to fully come through."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,24,"Chocolate and spice dominate this wine. It is very dry, very firm, extracted but intense, the fruit only slowly coming through the other flavors. A potentially impressive wine, from vineyards high up the Douro, this is worth aging 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,34,"Ripe and spicy, this is an impressive, solid, new wood-dominated wine. The tannins come from high toast as well as the concentrated blackberry juice fruits. That makes it dry, a wine that needs to soften. But it has all the intensity that are the hallmarks of top Douro wines, so try it again in a year."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,10,"A hearty, red-fruited wine with soft tannins, licorice and a fresh, juicy character. This is a soft wine, attractively balanced, the warm Alentejo sunshine filling the glass."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,11,"Soft and fresh, a wine with delicious acidity, almonds and pink grapefruit flavors. A mineral edge comes through to give a vibrant aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,7,"Fresh, herbal and stalky, a light-bodied red wine that has some well-balanced residual sugar to go with the red berry fruits. The soft texture masks the acidity. Screw cap."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,11,"A bizarre blend of the hybrid Negra Mole and Trincadeira. The is soft, rather heavy in texture, rich plum flavors, lacking acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,92,44,"A wood-aged wine that exhibits the richest of fruit. The wood is well-integrated, a sweet spice element within the quince, sweet pear and apricot flavors. Textured and with acidity, this hangs together richly and with style."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,45,"Smoky, meaty aromas set the scene for an intensely rich wine. If the wood element is very apparent in the smoke and spice flavors, this is youth. Underneath, there is a concentrated dark series of black fruits, bacon and big, dry tannins. The wine needs to age for at least four years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,46,"A big wine in every sense, from its bold black fruits and dark chocolate flavors to its layer upon layer of tannin, acidity, wood and then more fruit. Obviously for aging, this needs at least 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,18,"Parcels of old vines produce this complex wine. It has dark black berry fruits while still retaining freshness over the bone-dry tannins. There is a depth to the structure, pushing the wine but not going over the top. Age for 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,91,46,"Herbal aromas lead to a fresh, green and white fruit wine that sips easily with a definite herbaceous character. The wood aging adds a good nutmeg character, but it is the freshness that makes this wine so delicious. Age for another year."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,91,40,"Finely perfumed, a wood-aged wine, smooth and creamy. There is an attractive mix of toast with apricot and white peach flavors, full in the mouth. With its herbs and spice edge, this could probably benefit from another year's aging."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,34,"Although the Santar estate is now managed by the Dão Sul company, it remains family-owned, the house a local showplace. The Reserva is an impressive rich wine, dominated by Touriga Nacional. Mineral but ripe, it has black plum skins as well as wood tannins giving a balanced, firm structure. Spice and tobacco aromas complete a finely judged wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,35,"This complex blend of Syrah, Touriga Franca, Alicante Bouschet and Trincadeira is very successful. It works because the tannins are so well integrated with the big, ripe fruit, and because the structure is firm without being too dominant. It is ready to drink now, the exuberant fruits filling the mouth, the wood a sub-layer adding balance."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,37,"Dense and powerful, this is an impressively concentrated and intense wine. It brings out rich tannins, equally rich black plum and spice flavors, a layer of smokiness plus a strong slash of minerality that cuts across the texture. For aging 5–6 years."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,16,"Ripe pear fruit flavors go with green plums in the wine that has acidity, but does seem just too hot and heavy."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,22,"Farmyard aromas follow through to a firmly dry, darkly tannic wine with bitter licorice flavors. It has spice from wood, but a rustic character dominates."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,9,"Attractive red fruits and a good juicy character alongside soft tannins. This is an easy wine, ready to drink now."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,83,18,"A fat, rich rosé, full of ripe berry fruits, caramel and spice. It misses out on freshness, and the alcohol does give a burn."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,16,"Soft, ripe wine with some attractive red berry fruits, touches of mint and leather tannic edge."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,18,"A deliciously rich and spicy wine, very much in the style of the new Douro wines, softly perfumed, with black plums, sweet and dusty tannins, only a hint of dryness. The wine is balanced, with great fruit and acidity to go with the structure."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,57,"Named after João Maria, born in 2004, this Cabernet/Syrah blend is a dark, solid wine, a powerhouse of new wood, dry tannins and a burst of juicy, black, intense fruits. It has a touch of pepper as well as perfumed, polished wood and final spice. Produced in half bottles and magnums."
Portugal,Petit Verdot,Red,91,30,"It's very rare to find a 100% Petit Verdot, the Bordeaux variety that adds a percentage or two of spice to wines in the Médoc. The color is dark, almost black, while the wine's tannins are sweet, chocolaty and flavored with toasty spice. With its big blackberry jam texture, this is dense and solid, a powerful, ripe wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,95,46,"The legendary Mouchão, one of Portugal's most revered wines, has finally made it to this country. Made in traditional open stone fermenters, this is not a modern wine. It's a wine, whose dark tannins and dense fruits demand attention and time. At this stage—six years in—it remains a baby, but in another five years, it will start to be a great wine, one that will show a hedonistic mix of power and beauty."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,13,"Curious stalky fruit aromas don't translate well in this rather lean wine. It has black currant fruits, light tannins, prominent acidity, but lacks balanced density."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,60,"Any doubts that Portugal's Alentejo region can rival many big New World wines would be dispelled by this extravagant wine. With its intense fruit, sweet tannins, figs, coffee and spice flavors, it packs a serious punch of flavor. For drinking now."
Portugal,Trincadeira,Red,90,13,"A black, solid wine, spiced heavily with wood but still showing blackberry flavors, textured with plum skins. The wine feels warm and ripe, finishing with black cherries and lingering softness."
Portugal,Aragonês,Red,90,50,"Aragonês (Tinta Roriz or Tempranillo) is given intense power in the Alentejo. It has sold fruits, black cherry and spice flavors, with a big shoulder of tannins and vivid acidity. A wine for aging—3 to 4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,40,"It's the French wood aging that gives this wine its Plus moniker. It brings out elegant perfumes, the black fruits rich and smooth, although there is always a core of Douro dry tannins. In its richness, it is possible to see a link with Port. On the finish, though, the acidity and dry tannins remind us of table wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,90,"Ripe and smooth, with mature velvet texture, figs, milk chocolate and ripe plums. Hints of wood aging are there, but they blend easily with the rich fruit."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,36,"A lean, cool, initially austere wine, well balanced with red berry fruits and a poised elegant structure. The acidity gives great freshness to go with the structure, making a great food wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,15,"A smooth, rounded wine, with depth of black berry, dark plum and licorice flavors. It is solid, chunky, powerfully ripe, full of pepper, spice as well as sweet acidity. Very enticing and rich."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,90,20,"Ripe lime aromas and a full richly fruity palate give a rounded character to this wine. Apricot juice and tangerine brighten up the palate, fitting well with the wood and fruit structure. Keep for another few months for the whole wine to fill out even more."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,89,36,"Made from Cerceal, this is a delicious wine, lifted by some wood flavors giving a creamed baked apple flavor, with white currants and a final, refreshing burst of citrus."
Portugal,Antão Vaz,White,89,27,"Antão Vaz is the Chardonnay of Portugal, and this wine shows all the right creaminess and smooth, opulent texture. It has weight of course, but also enough freshness, peaches vying with lime, leaving good acidity."
Portugal,Madeira Blend,Red,93,40,"Slightly richer than the Charleston Sercial, the Boston Bual boasts knockout aromas of toasted nut oil, orange peel and hints of dark honey or maple syrup. Despite the extra weight and sweetness, it's not cloying at all—the finish is mouthwatering and long."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,61,"Initially, this is a fruit-dominated wine, with a cherries-in-syrup flavor. Only gradually do the tannins and the stalky but rich texture come in to suggest aging potential. The wine finishes with the fresh edge typical of 2007."
Portugal,Madeira Blend,Red,93,40,"The sweetest and richest in the Historic series, the New York Malmsey unfolds slowly in the glass, gradually revealing layers of depth and flavor. Coffee, toffee and date notes emerge, followed by earthy, almost truffley flavors. Powerful and assertive on the long finish."
Portugal,Madeira Blend,Red,93,40,"The Historic Series are simply great Madeiras at reasonable prices. The Charleston Sercial is the driest of the collection, offering nutty aromas tinged with honey, caramel and maple syrup. Dried figs, honey and candied citrus flavors mark the palate, which is wonderfully smooth. The long finish features racy yet balanced acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,25,"A wine that is layered with new wood that dominates the fruit. The tannins are all from this wood, freshly sawn, leaving the obviously fine fruit lagging behind. It needs at least three years to come into balance."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,24,"The second wine of the Bruno Prats and Symington family joint venture, this is a deliciously fruity wine, but with a fine elegant backbone of light tannins and smoky wood. As befits a second wine in the Bordeaux tradition, this is ready to drink."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,22,"Perfumed wine, deliciously aromatic but also structured. This is balanced, intently tannic. The fruit is equally important, the black currant juice and refreshing acidity a counterbalance to the tannins."
Portugal,Antão Vaz,White,89,15,"Oily-textured wine, flavored with mango and peaches. It's so soft and unctuous that freshness seems to have been left behind. In its place is the ripest fruit giving an open texture and an opulent aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,66,"As you might expect—but see all too rarely—this Douro table wine comes close in character to Port, with bold, blackberry fruit-filled aromas that verge on being overripe. It's got ample alcohol but not to excess, with a firm structure of acid and tannins to hold things in place. Long on the finish; give this 3–5 years to round out and develop some more nuances."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,9,"A blend of Caradoc (a cross of Malbec and Grenache) and Tinto Roriz, this is a bold ripe wine that pushes its vivid berry fruits right up front along with some dark tannins. Black cherries and figs show well at the end, along with wood spice and acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,75,"A big, bold, robust wine, dominated by black berry fruits and a deep layer of spice and toast. It is very rich, the tannins showing some structure, with the acidity buried in sweet, ripe fruit."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,88,28,"A firm, solidly tannic wine that is balanced easily between tight fruit tannins, elegant plum fruits and taut acidity. The aftertaste is smoky from the wood, but with the fruit always present."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,10,"A fresh, juicy wine with berry fruits, ripe but intense tannins and a black cherry flavor. There is a delicious, final burst of acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,25,"Wood-aged and almost black in color from the ripe, sweet berry fruit flavors and the velvet, opulent layers of polished wood and tannins. It's certainly a powerhouse of flavors, but the dry core keeps it from being out of balance, while the aftertaste is sweet and dry at the same time. Impressive."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,32,"Meat, bacon and plum skin aromas are followed by dense, ripe tannins, piled on by black, solid fruits. This is a powered, intense wine, with superrich fruit, but encased in dry tannins."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,37,"A young, powerful wine, dominated by bitter chocolate, cocoa and dense ripe black fruits. The wood element lifts this mix of flavors and gives a great sense of structure. Dark figs and herbs add complexity, while the tannins are powerful."
Portugal,Sercial,White,91,21,"In a recent series of entry-level Madeiras, this was a standout, offering excellent complexity and richness at a reasonable price. Nuts, toffee and dried fruit aromas and flavors swirl together, balancing moderate sweetness with harmonious acids. Long on the finish."
Portugal,Malmsey,White,91,37,"Mildly syrupy in texture, this is an intensely sweet Madeira balanced by racy acidity. Rancio and brown sugar aromas lead the way, followed by flavors of caramelized nuts, molasses and burnt citrus peel. Excellent length on the finish, where the crisp acids really shine."
Portugal,Arinto,White,92,29,"An impressive white wine, made from the classy Arinto grape. The wine has been aged in wood, but the creamy toast blends easily with the rich white fruits. There is a Chardonnay-like richness here, a wine that is round, smooth, with just a final lift of acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,26,"A closed, dark, tight wine, with an austere, mineral character, that obviously needs considerable aging. Smoky, meaty, dark tannins are dominant here, the black berry fruit showing through the powerful structure. Keep for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,34,"A powerful expression of Touriga Nacional, from a single vineyard in the Dão revealing ripe structured fruits along with dark, linear tannins. The wine has spice, but the fruits are darkly dry, with a tense, firm aftertaste. Age for 2–3 years."
Portugal,Arinto,White,92,14,"Pure Arinto from the Lisbon region, this wood-aged wine is delicious and Chardonnay-like in its richness, with great swathes of apples and cream flavors, layered with toast. This is a great advertisement for a neglected region in Portugal's viticulture."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,15,"A powerful, punchy wine that brings richness along with acidity to a blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Barocca and Tinta Roriz. The smoothness of the surface hides firm, dusty tannins, with wild fig and dark plum flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,13,"Fine floral wine, the perfumes giving a further lift to the already fresh melon and lime fruits. There's an attractive chewy structure from apple skins, finishing with the crispest acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,28,"A lean, cool, initially austere wine, well balanced with red berry fruits and a poised elegant structure. The acidity gives great freshness to go with the structure, making a great food wine."
Portugal,White Blend,White,90,12,"The name sounds Italian, but this is made in Portugal's Douro Valley, up in the hills near the Spanish border. According to the importer, it's a blend of indigenous Códega, Viosinho and Rabigato grapes. Whatever it is, it shows skillfully managed barrel treatment in its lush, rich, creamy texture and vanilla notes, but those elements seamlessly blend with ripe citrus (think oranges or tangerines) and gingery spice. A long finish cements this wine's impressive quality."
Portugal,Bual,White,90,32,"Incredibly nutty on the nose, with hints of citrus and caramel. On the palate, lemon and orange flavors take off, although hints of honey-roasted nuts continue in the background. This is a fresh, mostly dry-seeming Madeira with a long, intense finish."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,92,36,"A serious, impressive wine, packed with the dark tannins of Touriga Nacional. It also has an elegance that gives it shape, structure and surprising poise for such a rich, juicy wine. The fruit is ripe, flavored with dark berries, cranberry tannins and some wood spice. Age for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,18,"Made from a collection of old varieties, with delicious ripe fruit, dark tannins and a powerful structure. The texture is surrounded by sweet fruit, super-rich plums, black figs, the exuberant fruit balanced by a more austere, serious side."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,32,"Many see the Touriga Nacional in the Dão as superior to the same grape in the Douro. As in this wine, it has power and richness, but with extra complexity, the fruit powered by dark tannins. The structure is solid, with a firm, spicy elegance."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,10,"The estate wine from Casal Branco is impressive and structured, with dried berry fruits, dark, dry tannins and a solid structure. The acidity is very present, helping to keep the wine fresh, but the complex dark flavors and spice are certainly there to allow the wine to age over the next 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,13,"This is stylish Douro, a wine that reveals minerality, red berry fruits with tannins and acidity that cut through the structure. This wine is ready to drink."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,21,"Firm, dark and dry, this is a wine with great depth of flavor, concentrating tannins over the bold black fruits and new wood flavors. It certainly could be aged, but can also be drunk now for its spicy richness and solid texture."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,30,"A broad, welcoming wine, the second label from Malhadinha Nova. It has spiced acidity, flavors of plums, licorice, with cranberry juice tannins. The flavors are big and bold, nothing held back."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,38,"It's mainly (80%) Alicante Bouschet with 10% each Syrah and Touriga Nacional, but this wine bears something of a resemblance to Port. Dark chocolate and blueberry notes show up on the nose, although there are also bright raspberry and vanilla flourishes. Long and a bit peppery on the finish, this is a winter-weight red to have alongside braised meats."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,18,"This Symington family table wine program is going well, to judge by this excellent 2003 Reserva. It packs plenty of lush blackberry fruit into a creamy, medium-bodied wine with supple tannins. Accents of vanilla and spice add nuance to the nose and midpalate, while some peppery notes add length to the finish. Drink now–2010, possibly longer."
Portugal,Malmsey,White,90,21,"Don't let the medium  you—that's how this is supposed to look. Malmsey is the sweetest of the Madeiras, and this one is intensely sweet, yet also lemony-tart at the same time, with flavors of black walnuts, molasses and coffee."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,14,"A terrific value, Casa da Alorna's 2003 Colheita Seleccionada is a darkly colored wine imbued with a round, lush mouthfeel and long, velvety finish. Slightly herbal (mint?) and meaty notes add complexity to black cherry and plum flavors. A blend of Castelão (Periquita), Trincadeira and Tinta Miúda."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,90,25,"A blend of Syrah, Touriga Nacional and Alfrocheiro, this wine is loaded with bold blackberry fruit and lashings of vanilla. Definitely not for the shy, it's intense but adds enough spice and tobacco flavors to avoid any claims of simplicity or jamminess. Drink now or hold 4–5 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,40,"An impressive wine that takes its name from the chalk and clay soils of the vineyards. It has acidity, sweet tarry characters, blackberries, cranberry juice and dense, dense tannins. The final burst of acidity sets the whole wine in context. Age for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,18,"This is the last vintage of a joint venture between J M da Fonseca and Cristiano van Zeller (the 2005 is a solo production by J M da Fonseca). It's a dry, dark, structured wine, with some minerality, full of ripe black plums and concentrated tannins."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,35,"Dark fruits are the backbone of this fine wine, with flavors of blueberries, black cherry and figs along with smooth, polished wood. It is certainly big and dense, the tannins soft but concentrated. The finish is juicy and fruity, but dry."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,20,"A creamy, Chardonnay-like wine that is rich, open and generous. It has weight but keeps a sense of proportion with its balancing texture of fruit skins and herbs."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,80,"Reasonably lush but not unstructured, Cálem's 2000 vintage Port is a solid effort. Eucalyptus, coffee and plum scents mark the nose, while the flavors are fruit-forward plum and blackberry, with a smidgen of dark chocolate. Long and textured on the finish. Drink now-2020."
Portugal,Syrah,Red,89,23,"Dark and meaty, this Syrah shows its hot-weather climate without losing all of its nuance. Hints of anise, meat and dried spices add a layer of flavor atop the chocolate and black cherry base, while the supple tannins and soft texture end gracefully."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,50,"A lovely single-quinta wine that can be drunk now and over the next 10-15 years, Ventozelo's 2000 is a supple, creamy-textured Port that features slightly briary herbal-floral accents to its dark berry flavors. Picks up some intriguing spice notes on the finish, so it's not just a fruit bomb."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,45,"Garrafeira in Portugal means a special selection, and this wine, from low yielding vines, has an impressive concentration. Its dark chocolate and mature spice flavors are just part of a powerfully fruity wine, all dark plum skins and sweet acidity. Ready to drink now, but could age."
Portugal,Encruzado,White,90,12,"Made from the Dão's very own white grape, this wine shows a fine balance between creamy, ripe yellow fruits, spice and a tense mineral streak. The new wood flavors give the wine a great richness and lift, a final roundness over the fresh fruits."
Portugal,Arinto,White,90,18,"A barrel-aged white, with crisp acidity made rich by spice and toast. The balance is just right, the stone yellow fruits giving ripe softness, while minerality and acidity provide the contrast."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,10,"This value Douro wine shows firm tannins and acidity. But it also has the brightest black berry fruits to balance that layer of dryness. It is a solid wine that reveals minerality, firm flavors and a final black fig sweetness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,24,"It's a second label, but the quality is still very good, with blackberry and black cherry fruit amped up by the addition of wood spice and vanilla. Tannins are supple, yet firm enough to give the bold fruit focus and structure on the finish. Drink now–2010."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,89,13,"Deliciously spicy and citrusy, this blend of Arinto, Rabo de Ovelha and Roupiero is quickly becoming one of Portugal's go-to whites. Pepper and ginger notes lead the way, backed by fresh pineapple fruit. A slightly oily mouthfeel gives it some heft, but the finish is spice-driven and refreshing, not heavy. Drink now."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,90,16,"Coming from the Alvarinho region of Monção in the far north of Portugal, this is a rich wine, its creamy apple character brought out beautifully by its tight, steely edge. This has style, ripe fruit, a green plum skin edge to it, finished with vibrant acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,90,12,"A blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura, this is relatively full-bodied Vinho Verde. The creamy texture is the most apparent, always freshened with lively citric acidity, a very light prickle on the mouth. The wine is fragrant and crisp. Drink this summer, but also possible to age."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,16,"The flagship wine from Alorna is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon, the two grapes melding well into a rich, harmonious whole. Flavors of spice, black figs and dark plum skin tannins are smoothed by 12 months wood aging. There is an edge of youth, which suggests good aging potential."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,90,19,"A dark, brooding wine, packed with black fruits that are dominated by dry tannins. This is still young, but the dense blackberry fruit flavors are all here. Its weight and power need time to tame, but for now, the acidity and fruit are impressive."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,40,"The wine is young, the tannins very firm, with fruit that shows freshness, bright black berries and red plum skins. It needs at least one year."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,88,11,"This is a subsidiary label of Quinta da Cortezia that comes in two levels: Special Selection and regular. It's a modern-styled, fruit-focused wine, with blackberries leading the way, but buttressed by hints of mineral, peppery spice and chocolate. Long and mouthwatering on the finish. Drink now–2010."
Portugal,Bual,White,88,36,"Less nutty than other Madeiras despite being 10 years of age, this Bual has a striking bouquet that includes notes of fresh orange rinds. Flavors add dark honey notes to orange marmalade. Silky and smooth in the mouth, with a long, tangy finish."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,88,13,"In complete contrast to the same winery's Versátil, this wine's blend of cherries, dried spices and vanilla is terrifically appealing, with a firm structure that helps carry the weight of the fruit. Drink now or hold 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,15,"A blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz, with big, dusty tannins, ripe new wood and black, jammy fruit. The exuberance is held in check by minerality, but the final effect is of a ripe, satisfying wine, the spicy new wood showing strongly."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,19,"Escolha in Portuguese indicates an aged wine, and this solid, chunky red has obviously softened by wood and bottle aging. It has a velvet, warming texture, its black plum and berry fruits smoothing out the tannins. There is a great burst of juicy acidity to finish. Delicious to drink now, but worth aging."
Portugal,Alfrocheiro,Red,90,30,"There's plenty going on here, from the sweet tannins and strawberry flavors to the leathery, mature edge. The wine is so ripe, its structure keeping the generous fruit together, but allowing an almost opulent character to dominate."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,22,"Only the second garrafeira (the name means special selection) made by the Borba cooperative, this is a serious, complex wine that wears its tannins and rich fruits lightly. The dried fruits, chocolate and edge of bitterness all promise aging potential. There's a fresh, juicy feel to the aftertaste, before the spice from wood aging kicks back in."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,12,"A richly ripe wine, full of tarry, dark tannins and black fruits. Despite its weight and density, it is well balanced, the dark flavors opening out with flavors of licorice, bitter chocolate and spicy wood."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,20,"A bruiser of a wine, big, fat and rather heavy. It is based on superripe, maybe overripe fruit, the tannins keeping some hold on the intense flavors, but not quite enough."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,8,"A smooth wine, brightened with flavors of William pear, a zest of lime and a light touch of vanilla. It has attractive acidity, the fruit sitting well with the freshness."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,40,"Even for a ruby, this is dark purple in color and attractively saturated in the glass. It's somewhat grapy, but avoids simplicity by blending in hints of mulberries, chocolate and spice. Full-bodied and slightly tannic, it shows good grip for a basic ruby, although a touch of heat does show through on the finish. Not available in the U.S."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,90,"A round, lushly fruited vintage Port, the 2000 Rozès boasts scents of toffee, chocolate and prune, then follows up with flavors of chocolate fudge and dark plum. Has enough structure to age another 10 years, just lacks a little length on the finish. Imported by Vranken America."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,88,15,"A touch deeper and richer than the regular bottling, this reserva features scents of plum, cola and earth to start, then shows off an ample, soft texture in the mouth. Flavors are rich and loamy, with flecks of bright fruit that shine through. Round, mouthfilling and easy to drink."
Portugal,Bual,White,88,34,"Surprisingly light in body, a result of this wine's elegantly wrought balance between acid and sugar. The aromas are fresh, almost briny, while the flavors marry honey and dried apricots without intense sweetness. Long on the finish, where it folds in nutty notes."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,26,"A firmly dry wine, driven by the dark tannins, only opening slowly to give ripe berry fruits. The soft side of the wine does bring out the lighter nature of the Baga in the blend, which has been tamed by wood aging. There is a final flourish of fresh black plum juice."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,90,34,"Made jointly by Filipa Pato and her husband William, a blend of Encruzado from Dão and Bical from Bairrada, and cask fermented. It is a beautiful wine, dense, concentrated, rich and creamy, a mouthfilling wine with white figs, and a green plum skin texture."
Portugal,Shiraz,Red,90,11,"Its dark color promises power, and this wine delivers a broad, chunky Shiraz, with perfumed fruit, dark tannins and a spicy wood structure. Solid concentration gives a wine that somehow manages to assimilate a Franco/Australian variety into a dry Portuguese structure."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,29,"You want big, bold flavors, plenty of spicy wood? It's all here inside the heavyweight bottle. In fact, the spice is the most dominant character, flavors of grated nutmeg going right over the dark, closed tannins and big, brooding fruit. Give it 2–3 years."
Portugal,Encruzado,White,90,20,"The Dão's very own white variety, Encruzado gives a citric, bright lime and grapefruit wine, with a delicious bite of pear skin. This is a fine example of the grape, rounded at the edges, with an outburst of fresh acidity, very fresh, but worth aging for 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,14,"Already showing signs of maturity, this is a full, ripe wine, with licorice and black fruit flavors, hinting also at coffee. The wood gives firm but dusty tannins, leaving an openness to the wine, along with an element of spiciness. The aftertaste is full and dry, with good acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,18,"This is all about rich, tarry red fruit flavors, layered with some dense fruit tannins. It's a warm wine from a hot place, concentrated and full. With flavors of superripe black fruits, this could be aged, but is definitely ready to drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,14,"In homage to a major product of the region, this wine has a cork label. It has considerable power, an old-fashioned, astringent wine that keeps the typical ultradry tannins as a sign of its ability to age. The fruit is definitely in second place here, although there are concentrated black fruits in the background. Age for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,13,"A ripe, smooth wine, dominated by juicy Trincadeira that has been tamed by 12 months wood aging. There's great spice, toast, dark berry fruits and good concentration. The tannins and the fine acidity promise aging potential."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,87,8,"A great value in everyday table wine, Quinta da Cortezia's second label offers bright cherry fruit accented by just enough mineral and spice elements to keep you coming back for another sip. A slightly creamy texture is balanced by crisp acids on the finish. Drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,26,"This medium-bodied blend of Touriga Nacional (45%), Touriga Franca (35%) and Tinta Roriz (20%) lacks a bit of flesh, but you wouldn't call it lean, either. Instead, it's sinewy in texture and feel, with masses of blackberry and mulberry fruit upfront and dusty, slightly drying notes on the finish."
Portugal,Verdelho,White,87,21,"More elegant than many Madeiras in this price range, with delicate aromas and flavors of nuts, coffee and toffee that aren't overpowering. It's sweet and very smooth in the mouth, ending with honeyed flavors that are balanced by a lemony tang."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,55,"Looking for a Portuguese Bordeaux? This offering from the Lafite branch of the Rothschild family fits the bill, despite its inclusion of indigenous Portuguese grape varieties. A veneer of cedary oak coats an earthy core of mulberry flavors in this medium-bodied red wine. Supple and earthy on the finish. Drink now–2015."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,10,"With its blend of Touriga Nacional, Castelão and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine successfully blends Portugal and France. There is already some maturity here, the wine soft, with red berries and a leather tannin character. Ready to drink now, with a final fresh acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,89,20,"A smooth, toasty wine, with distinct caramel and vanilla flavors, on top of ripe mangos and apricots. The Bical grape that dominates the blend gives a delicious creamy texture."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,17,"A blend of grapes from Filipa Pato's vineyards in Bairrada and Dão, very aromatic, with a smooth, silky texture. The wine shows ripeness, sweet berries and perfumed black currant, violets and licorice."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,89,11,"It is called Point West because Estremadura's vineyards are the furthest west in Europe. The wine itself is soft and fruity initially, but then there is a tight tannic texture, followed by black currant fruits. The wine is finely made, elegant, just on the warm side of cool."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,12,"A finely balanced wine, uniting toast and wood flavors with ripe plums in a harmonious whole. There are spice, soft tannins and light acidity. Elegant rather than powerful, this is an excellent food wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,15,"A fine, firm, structured wine that shows richness along with elegance. Fresh, black fruits ride over dry tannins and acidity, allowing this to be a food-friendly wine that could benefit from some aging. To finish, the lifted, vibrant fruits leave a ripe, clean taste."
Portugal,Malvasia Fina,White,89,20,"Sweet citrus-flavored wine, with a good intensity of flavor from the ripe Malvasia grapes. There's a delicious perfumed character, pineapple and tangerine. The acidity is a fine part of this rich wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,20,"Soft and rich, this is powerful stuff. The texture is velvety smooth, the dark tannins very much second fiddle to the superripe fruit. Raisins and red fruits bring in some acidity, but even this fruit flavor is almost sweet in its richness. Drink now."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,89,14,"Ripe, smooth, velvet textured wine, layering dark chocolate, black plum skins, dense tannins and a big, solid structure. It tastes powerful from the ripe tannins and big fruit, finishing with fresh acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,24,"A smooth, well-integrated wine, showing sweet fruits, flavors of stewed red plums, with bright acidity. The proportions are all there, a wine that has style and freshness, as well as just the right fruit density."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,8,"This dry Vinho Verde shows great crisp, green apple and grapefruit flavors, a deliciously fresh wine, with green edges and lively flavors. Great summer drink."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,14,"A densely tannic wine, dry with bitter dark cocoa and black fruit flavors. The concentration of fruit and tannin is impressive, and gives considerable complexity of fruit as it powers alongside the dryness. It needs aging for the rough edges to smooth out, probably 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,12,"A fresh, lightly sparkling Vinho Verde, with crisp green apples and a light, summery poise of acidity, finishing with grapefruit."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,60,"From old, mixed planting vineyards in the Quinta do Vallado, this is an impressively complex blend of flavors, from rich spice, smooth tannins, the richest plum juice and a gorgeous, opulent texture. It is ripe, drinkable now, but likely to benefit from several years aging."
Portugal,White Blend,White,87,17,"From a mix of old indigenous white grapes, this wine reveals a producer making a stab at something different with character. It's broad and mouthfilling, framed by plenty of toasty oak and dried spices, but it also features honey and melon flavors that help support the wood."
Portugal,Muscat,White,86,14,"Very perfumed and floral on the nose, with spicy, lychee notes that almost suggest Gewürztraminer, but don't have the same weight or unctuous feel on the palate. It's a light-bodied dry Muscat, rather unique and interesting, and makes nice counterpoint to various tapas."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,86,12,"This is a fun, bouncy wine that actually seems a bit Syrah-like. Juicy cherry-berry flavors follow plum and black amber color and greenish tinge to the wine bother  pepper scents, while the finish is mouthwatering and fresh. Perfect for casual grilling."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,86,39,"This ambitious wine from the south of Portugal blends Alicante Bouschet, Aragonês, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, then covers much of the nuance with a veil of charred oak. Tarry, meaty, cedary notes on the nose; some cola, coffee and beet flavors. Woody on the finish. Hold 2–3 years and hope the impact of the wood lessens over time."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,8,"Reasonably complex for a modestly priced table wine, with intriguing notes of wintergreen, birchbeer, mushrooms and beet root. For some tastes, it could use a stronger fruit component, but despite that it's supple enough on the palate to charm. Finishes crisp, with some tart berry flavors. A blend of Trincadeira, Aragonês and Alfrocheiro."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,11,"Shows some definite sous bois elements—including damp moss, mushroom and cola notes—then adds tart berries and an easy, facile mouthfeel. Crisp and fresh on the finish. A pleasant lightweight red for everyday drinking."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,86,12,"Dark-fruited and earthy, with cedar and coffee shadings that give the wine an even darker demeanor. This medium-bodied wine boasts some dry, woody tannins that suggest another year or two of cellaring prior to primetime consumption. Sturdy rather than charming."
Portugal,Arinto,White,89,19,"A fine, elegant wood-aged wine. It has ripe fruits, sweet peach, apricot, mango, while the vanilla of toast lifts all the flavors, adding spicy smoothness. Acidity comes from fresh lime. It could do with some aging, maybe 2–3 years."
Portugal,Pinot Noir,Red,89,25,"An exotic blend including Pinot Noir and Merlot along with Portuguese varieties, taking its name from two local villages with saint's names. It has acidity and an awkward bitter edge, with tough black fruits. Maybe it needs time for the wine to soften and meld with the tight acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,15,"A densely dry wine, the tannins dominating the fruit. In style, it harks back to the more tannic offerings from the Dão, but with a more modern interpretation that brings in berry fruits and a final fresh, juicy character."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,11,"An elegant style, the ripe fruit restrained and kept in check by the dry tannins and acidity. The flavors start lightly, but then the wine gives a fine intensity and concentration as it opens up. The berry flavors are balanced by the dried fruits, with a new wood layer coming through to finish. Worth aging for 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,17,"The main estate wine from Quinta dos Roques, this offers mature fruit, with acidity, layers of black figs, chocolate and licorice, as well as red plum juice. It is finely structured, giving some elegance to go with its complex flavors."
Portugal,Touriga Franca,Red,88,10,"This wine is flavorful, with plenty of blackberry fruit, as well as a dense, tannic heart. The fruit's edges are smoothed by the wood aging, but it is still fruit that dominates, ripe, hearty and packed with acidity to finish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,16,"Ripe and smooth, balancing dense black fruit flavors with spice, wood and acidity, this is a solid, concentrated wine. It has a good restrained power, although the pepper hints at the alcohol. It certainly demands rich food."
Portugal,Touriga Franca,Red,88,19,"All spice, juicy fruit and dry tannins, this certainly evokes the spirit of the grape. There is a mineral quality to the red berry fruits, which comes through in the youthful, firm edge. Give this wine another two years so the  fruit will open up."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,10,"A wood-aged white with light toast character to complement the creamy pear and melon flavors. It is full in the mouth, rounded and soft."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,11,"A bright, fruity wine, with a layer of earthiness and gentle tannins. Flavors of red currants, beetroot and perfumed herbs meld together, while the lively acidity sets a good seal on the aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,8,"Spicy wine from the wood and from the ripe berry fruits. The acidity is light, a sideshow to the juicy fruit, flavors of nutmeg and red cherries and a fine kick of dry tannin."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,10,"Juicy, sweet fruited wine, with a ripe, jammy character allied to fresh acidity and soft tannins. With enticing raspberry flavors, the wine is for easy and early drinking."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,93,40,"A blend of Chardonnay and Maria Gomes, here is a ripe wood- and apricot-flavored wine. It is full, spicy, livened by crispness from a red apple skin texture. The vanilla from the wood adds a delicious richness to this impressive wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,50,"A step up from the Follies range, this is a big and richly smooth black wine, its tannins well integrated into the great plum juice fruits. The wine is ripe, now ready to drink, the final blackberry acidity giving a bright boost."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,11,"A bone-dry, slightly spritzy Vinho Verde, all sparkle and brightness. The crisp citrus and grapefruit character is fresh, vital and refreshing. This is what Vinho Verde is all about."
Portugal,Jaen,Red,88,26,"The Jaen, known in Bierzo, Spain as Mencia, gives freshly juicy wines, but with a definite edge of structure. This example has those characters, as well as concentration and ripeness. It is balanced, elegant, a great food wine."
Portugal,Baga,Red,88,11,"Bairrada's difficult grape, the Baga, needs time for aging, which is what has happened here. The result is a wine that is fragrant, not heavy, poised and fresh. The red berry fruits are lifted by acidity, there is a tell-tale Baga dry tannic core, but well in balance. A great food wine."
Portugal,Cabernet Sauvignon,Red,88,13,"A very Portuguese version of Cabernet Sauvignon, with sweet, jammy red berries and only light tannins. The fruit has freshness, but the dominant character is sweetness, ripeness, a wine full of final juicy acidity."
Portugal,Arinto,White,88,13,"Crisp, structured wine, showing the fruit skin and bite that makes Arinto such an interesting variety. There is an orange zest edge, emphasizing lightness, freshness, finishing a delicious wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,83,120,A very old wine which smells medicinal and tastes like sweet cough syrup. It's so concentrated as to be almost undrinkable.
Portugal,Port,Red,83,130,This wine certainly doesn't taste its age. It has more to do with sweet almond cookies and unbalanced spirit than mature flavors. Imported by Langdon Shiverick.
Portugal,Port,Red,83,30,"A hugely, almost uncomfortably sweet wine with strong aromatics. It has some attractive acidity, but the sweetness detracts from any other character."
Portugal,Arinto,White,86,12,"For a white wine from hot Estremadura, this shows admirable freshness, with apple, pear and nectarine flavors touched with hints of mint and graphite. It's medium- to full-bodied, but finishes dry and steely without being hard."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,12,"A solid value in ruby Port, Sandeman's bottling pairs dried fruits with leathery notes to offer more than simple, grapy fruit. Finishes with fresh, spicy notes. Imported by Pernod Ricard."
Portugal,White Blend,White,86,11,"A blend of indigenous varieties from the south of Portugal, this wine smoothly blends green apple and citrus flavors with a slightly creamy texture, yet finishes zesty and fresh, with a hint of anise."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,16,"This is an elegant, restrained blend of Tinta Roriz, Castelão, Syrah and Alicante Bouschet, giving ripe fruit to go with the firm, dry tannins and a touch of wood. It could age another 2–3 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,16,"A juicy, spicy wine, packed with open, generous black fruits. The blend of Castelão and Trincadeira gives blackberries, some raisins and a smooth chocolate underlay."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,10,"A perfumed, juicy wine with delicious red fruits and well adjusted with acidity. There are good, dry tannins as well, suggesting this will make a good food wine. The aftertaste has chewy structure and acidity."
Portugal,Fernão Pires,White,88,12,"A wood-aged, rich wine that shows big, ripe fruits and a good spice and toast element from the wood, balanced by white nectarines and currants. It is full, rounded and creamy."
Portugal,Tinta Roriz,Red,88,19,"A firm, ripe wine, with great red fruit flavors, dark tannins and an edge of coffee. There is some toast element here in this still young wine. Hopefully the just overripe fruit edge will disappear as it develops."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,10,"A light, modern, just off-dry and fruity wine, freshened by bright lime and apricots, with a tang of orange zest. This is crisp, very clean, a good apéritif drink."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,85,8,"Soft, smooth and ripe wine, its strawberry flavors just off-dry. The acidity makes a good balance, lifting the wine and emphasizing the light tannic touch. A good food rosé."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,13,"A superripe, soft wine, all pear and yellow fruit flavors, touched with apricot juice and light honey and lemon. The wine rolls smoothly with a light texture of pear skins."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,67,"A concentrated wine, still just beginning its journey. The fruits are packed into a firm and tannic structure that shows edges of wood. Berry and plum fruits dominate this powerful but well-balanced wine. Keep for 3–4 years."
Portugal,Port,Red,83,180,"A very old, too concentrated, medicinal, Italian bitters-flavored wine that tastes too herbal to give much pleasure. Imported by Wine Worth LLC."
Portugal,Port,Red,83,26,"Caramel, white chocolate aromas, and unbalanced sweet and sour flavors just do not show well together in this disappointing wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,82,50,"Dry, rather burnt, with sweetness, but dominated by unbalanced spirit."
Portugal,Port,Red,82,130,"Lovers of Italian bitters should pay attention to this wine. It's medicinal character is very intense, very herbal. Good for the stomach, maybe, but it's not Port."
Portugal,Port,Red,82,23,"This has a burnt, dry style, with high acidity. It tastes more mature than a 10-year-old."
Portugal,Port,Red,82,20,"Rather brown in color, this wine is sweet, soft and chocolaty, spoiled by volatility and unbalanced acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,82,53,"Very burnt and harsh, with spirit dominating, this is a sad showing for such a famous name."
Portugal,Tinta Negra Mole,Red,86,13,"On the lighter, fresher side of Madeira, with candied citrus flavors edging out honey and nut notes. Ends with a smoky, citrusy tang."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,86,16,"For a wine from warm Estremadura, this is a rather bright wine, marked by red cherries and sandalwood. Touches of dry oak and cocoa emerge on the finish."
Portugal,Arinto,White,86,10,"Primarily Arinto, this distinctive, interesting white comes across as a citrus-flavored spice drop, blending tangerine and lime with pepper and anise. It's not particularly fleshy, turning crisp on the finish. Probably best with simple seafood dishes."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,16,"Starts with simple aromas of roasted berries, but soon reveals a more complex side, marrying slightly herbal-grassy notes with ripe fruit and picking up hints of cocoa and dark chocolate on the finish."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,13,"Blending Alvarinho and Trajadura, oenologist Anselmo Mendes has created a deliciously creamy but dry style of Vinho Verde. The citrus character is there, but the texture is open, just hints of apple skins over the apricots and white peaches."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,30,"A blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon, with Touriga Nacional, to give a tight wine, solid, taking its austerity from the 2006 vintage. The berry fruits offer structure, and allow the wine to finish with a fresh note."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional Blend,Red,87,11,"Fast becoming one of the hallmark blends of Portugal, this 50-50 mix of Aragonez and Touriga Nacional is a seriously structured wine, with great wild fruit and mushroom flavors alongside dark, dry tannins. The acidity is very definite. A good food wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,15,"This popular wine is about fresh fruit, vividly displayed with red cherries and red plum flavors, light tannins and easy acidity. To drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,13,"Spicy toast and wood aromas are the prelude to a wine that is extra soft, velvet almost, only hinting at tannins. The acidity is what gives structure to this wine, the berry and fig flavors rounding it out."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,6,"The wine region of Lisboa (Lisbon) is the changed name for Estremadura's regional wines, although some confusion remains. This red in the Coreto range has some attractive berry fruits along with a soft, velvet structure that makes it an easy drink. Screwcap."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,92,13,"Alvarinho is the grape of northern Vinho Verde, giving a style that is rich and complex. The fruit here fits that character, packed with pear, apple and citrus flavors and a light texture of lime zest. Note: this wine is commercialized as Follies Alvarinho outside the U.S."
Portugal,Port,Red,81,49,"The burnt character is too dominant in this wine, and it smothers any fruit there is. Just a touch dry as well."
Portugal,Port,Red,81,40,"Tart, hard and burnt, this wine is completely spoilt by the harsh spirits which dominate."
Portugal,Port,Red,80,50,"There are many failings here: reductive, volatile, unbalanced acidity. But just somewhere there is a small streak of orange marmalade."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,85,13,"A perfectly solid Douro offering, one that easily blends dusty earth and mineral notes with black cherry fruit and a touch of herbs. Medium-bodied, it ends on a tea-like note."
Portugal,Tinta Negra Mole,Red,85,15,"This pale amber Madeira is lightly sweet, with nutty, slightly oxidized aromas that stay fresh and briny. Nuts and candied lemon flavors join coffee and caramel flavors on the finish, along with racy acidity. Worth trying with soup as a start to the evening."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,14,"Starts off with hints of mint, baked berries and earth, then delivers slightly herbal, medicinal fruit and chocolate flavors. Feels lush in the mouth, with no rough edges. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co."
Portugal,Fernão Pires,White,88,10,"A full, weighty, fat wine, almost new world Chardonnay in its texture and richness. It does come back to its roots, though, with the fresh melon and pear flavors in front of a definite mineral background. A food white, for good fish dishes, perhaps with spice."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,9,"The lovely spritz of fresh Vinho Verde bubbles out of the glass of this lively, crisp and citrus-flavored wine. It has the right edge of fruit skins giving structure to the summer fruits and acidity."
Portugal,Malvasia Fina,White,88,15,"From a 73-acre vineyard, owned by Quinta dos Roques, on the slopes of the Serra de Estrella, Portugal's highest mountains. With 10% wood aging, this is has a light vanilla touch, but that is quickly mixed with the ripe lemon and honey, peach and cantaloup melon flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,17,"A ripe and smooth wine, flavored with pears, white peach and spiced with gentle new wood. The touch of minerality comes from the chalk soils of the vineyards. The finish, though, comes back to smoothness, with an edge of acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,10,"Fresh and perfumed, this wine offers great citric flavors, a lively crispness rare in white wines from central Portugal. Pear and some yellow fruits give roundness."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,9,"The Estremadura region, north of Lisbon, is at the western extremity of mainland Europe. It produces a good line in this style of fresh, crisp wines, light and bright. There is just a hint of sweetness, with currant flavors and a final softness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,10,"A lively, fresh, lightly sweet wine, with raspberry and caramel flavors. It is crisp, but soft with an easy balancing acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,12,"Young citrus aromas, followed by a palate of creamy apple sauce and pears, light in flavor, but certainly fresh and fruity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,25,"Still young, this is a complex wine. It has layers of dusty tannins, spiced fruits, ripe blackberries and a dark structure. Black chocolate and licorice feed extra richness into the wine. Very smooth aftertaste."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,92,18,"Continuing the succession of fine wines from Aveleda's Quinta da Agueira in Bairrada, this is a powerful, firmly tannic but ultimately smooth wine. It has big ripe swathes of dark plums, figs and refreshing sweet acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,10,"A fine, ripe wine, with big, bold tannins, solid fruit and a structured black juice character. It is definitely rich in texture, but at the same time has a tight, mineral edge and restraint."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,15,"A ripe, full-bodied wine, the yellow peach and apricot flavors balanced with grapefruit, spice and a pear skin structure. There is a hint of vanilla from the wood, with a final, enticing floral character."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,84,16,"A bit confected, with aromas and flavors of jumbleberry pie drizzled with chocolate syrup. That's not to say it tastes sweet—it's dry—but the flavors boast a candied quality that limits their otherwise considerable appeal."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,84,9,"A fresh, fruit-driven style, marked by a touch of nail polish on the nose. It's medium-bodied, with tart cherry flavors on the palate."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,92,29,"A powerful, impressive wine, which brings together very ripe fruit and fine juicy acidity and solid tannins. The fruit is concentrated, black plums and a herbal layer. The aftertaste has acidity, but also ripeness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,23,"A rich, intense wine, a definite step up from the standard Periquita, smooth and packed with sweet, ripe red fruits, the juiciness of the Castelão grape tamed by the wood polish."
Portugal,Bastardo,Red,85,30,"The Bastardo grape is rare in the Douro, but it can produce a fresh style of red, fruity with red cherry juice and bright with cranberry acidity. For drinking young."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon,Red,91,13,"From the aroma, this seems heavily wooded, but on the palate the wood spice is becoming well integrated with the dark berry fruits and mineral texture. It is certainly young. Already, though, the fruit is showing its potential richness. Give it 3–4 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,90,"From old vines, on pre-phylloxera terraces, this is a powerful, concentrated wine. It is solid, packed with sweet rich fruits with an opulent texture. The acidity keeps the extravagance in check, but this is not a faint-hearted wine."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,91,13,"A broad style of wine, bringing in the richness of Alvarinho and the more crisp character of Loureiro. It is very much in Vinho Verde style, just with extra power to give a final creamy character."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,15,"From pure Touriga Nacional, this is already mature, with earthy overtones coming through to give leather aromas and flavors that are moving into spice, sweet wood and dark coffee. It has a great smooth texture with delicious final acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,6,"A big dense wine, as tough as the rocks that make up the Dão soil. Its fruit is certainly there, a welter of black berries and plums. But in this young wine, the tannins are still in charge. This is going to develop, opening up, becoming less mineral, over the next three years."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional Blend,Red,92,32,"As a contrast to the great fruity straight Touriga Nacional from the same producer, this is a much drier, firmer wine. The tannins are very dry, packed with wood flavors as well as berry fruits and layers of acidity. A wine for aging, this needs a good 5 years."
Portugal,Loureiro,White,92,25,"Wood and Vinho Verde don't mix, say the pundits. They can, if the wood is handled as sensitively as it is here. The toast is there, but its job is to enhance and enlarge the dense, intense green fruit flavors. A fine white wine that's creamy and delicious. Imported by European Cellars."
Portugal,Cabernet Sauvignon,Red,84,15,"Seems relatively mature already, showing herbal, tobacco-like scents and some earthy, loamy flavors. Leather and spice notes add complexity to the dry, dusty finish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,7,"Altano, a table-wine project of the Symington family, famous for their various Port houses (among them, Dow's, Graham's and Warre's), takes a two-pronged approach to marketing. A pricier Reserva offers greater richness and texture along with hints of oak, but while the entry-level Altano lacks the rich texture and density, it offers good value. Cherries and sappy green herb notes combine in a lightweight, easy quaffer that folds in dark chocolate and black tea notes on the finish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,13,"This could use a little more intensity, but it's a decent quaff, offering bright scents of sour plum and cherry alongside a duller, charred note. Chocolate and cherries on the palate, which is smooth and slightly creamy. Supple on the finish, this is ready to drink now."
Portugal,Trincadeira,Red,87,14,"Fresh and fruity, this is a wine that's all about juicy textures, ripe fruit, touched by dry tannins. Flavors of tomatoes, red plums and a lively acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,7,"This is Casal Branco's branded wine, designed to be drunk young. And that's exactly how it tastes, with bright, lively fruit, soft tannins, a very light vegetal hint, and a soft, almost jammy aftertaste. Highly enjoyable."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,6,"A soft and creamy wine, freshened with a little citrus. It has only light acidity, the main focus being pear and red apple flavors. It rolls easily around the palate, finishing freshly. Screwcap."
Portugal,Rosé,Red,84,6,"A lively, crisp wine, packed with bright raspberries, red cherries and acidity. It has a touch of caramel, but no more. The freshness is much more important. Screwcap."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,20,"A powerfully rich wine, packed with sweet plum juice and damson fruits. It has considerable density, its structure a firm edifice for the ripe fruits. Good aging potential here."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,16,"With plenty of weight, but weight that is concentrated around a tight, firm tannic core. The wine has great ripe plum and black cherry fruits, brimming from the glass. The acidity is a strong presence, and with the tannin promises several years' aging."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,35,"Broadened by spicy wood, this is a smooth, rich and opulent wine. It has sweet plum and black cherry flavors to go with its dense texture. There is a light sprinkling of pepper to go with the grated nutmeg and powerful core of tannins. For aging 5–6 years and more."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,19,"This is the greatest of the quintas planted by Dona Antonia Ferreira in the 19th century. It is in the Douro Superior, the driest, most remote part of the Douro. The Olazabal family, descendants of Dona Antonia, produce this hugely impressive, dark-hued wine, packed with dense, brooding tannins and solid, initially tough fruits, which open out to opulence and richness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,94,150,"Dark, dense and concentrated, with power and elegance. But somehow this complex wine also shows restraint and style. It has much to do with the pure richness of the fruit (from 90-year-old vines) as the acidity which lifts and restrains the power."
Portugal,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Red,87,38,"Literally meaning “Bordeaux soup,” this is a blend of Bordeaux varieties, including 25% Petit Verdot. It is big and powerful, with a hugely deep color, solid tannins and sweet acidity. Great juicy wafts come through the dark tannins."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,6,"Pear and creamy apples round out a soft, fruity wine. The Arinto grapes give a plum skin tightness to the structure, but the main character is of a full, ripe but also fresh wine."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,91,16,"Mendes specializes in Alvarinho in the far north of Portugal. With this powerful, intense wine he shows how good the grape can be and how good the 2005 vintage was. It's full-bodied and intense, with just a touch of mineral and spritz. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc."
Portugal,Loureiro,White,91,13,"This top estate in the Ponte de Lima area produces beautiful, hand-crafted wines. This 100% Loureiro is almost Riesling-like in its perfumes, while its green fruit shows hints of an almond character, as well as piercingly  clean ripeness and acidity. Imported by European Cellars."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,90,24,"This is one of the flagship estates of Vinho Verde, based in the northern Monsão region: its VVs are based on Alvarinho. Has Riesling-like perfumes, but the intensity, green fruit and citrus flavors are all Vinho Verde. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,23,"Weirdly floral on the nose, reminiscent of strawberry- or cherry-scented candles and somewhat akin to air freshener. Very red-fruity on the medium-weight palate, with a sweet-tart quality. Tasted three times, with consistent notes."
Portugal,Port,Red,83,16,"Basic Port, slightly syrupy and sweet, with dried cherry and chocolate flavors and a plump, easygoing mouthfeel. Imported by Pernod Ricard."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,10,"With what seems a stylistic change, this 2005 version of Periquita is firm, tannic, structured, with dark fruits and plenty of dry tannins. It is impressive for a big brand, dark and concentrated."
Portugal,Bical,White,86,15,"Rounded but also fruity, this soft wine is perfumed, hinting at white flowers and tropical fruits. While the acidity is low, the fruit is easy, ripe and lightly structured."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,17,"A wine that has some acidity, but also tastes somewhat hot. There is some spice from the wood aging, balancing the white plum and stone fruit flavors. What is missing is the acidity."
Portugal,Castelão,Red,84,8,"The wine tastes young, its fruits and wood characters not quite integrated. But it has a good light touch of redcurrants and blackberries to go with the acidity. The wood gives dry tannins and a firm structure."
Portugal,Petit Verdot,Red,91,44,"It is rare to find a pure Petit Verdot (the grape used in some blends in Bordeaux) anywhere, let alone in Portugal. The Alentejo is a good place, with guaranteed ripeness for this fickle grape. Dark in color, packed with dense tannins and a heavy layer of wood, this is not for the faint-hearted. It is certainly ripe and rich."
Portugal,Syrah,Red,90,24,"A firmly structured wine, its tannins well bedded into perfumed black plum fruits. It has juicy, fresh acidity over the rich fruits, giving brightness to an otherwise weighty wine."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,90,9,"Now in a smart clear blue bottle, this is Aveleda's estate wine. It is always a classic, with just some extra weight to give it distinction. The flavors are apple, brightened with lime, finishing with vibrant acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,35,"Smooth, wood and black fig flavored wine, rich and velvet in texture. The wine initially seems ready to drink, but then tannins kick in and it is obviously a wine with good aging potential. Certainly the weight, power and ripe fruit are all very evident."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,70,"The top wine in the Quinta do Portal range is in its second vintage. With 12 months aging in French oak, the power is all there in very dark, heavy tannins that dominate the fruit. This is a powerful expression of the richness and the structure of great Douro wines, all granite and mineral in character, dark and tough, sure to age well."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,93,56,"The joint venture between the Cazes family of Bordeaux and the Roquette family of Quinta do Crasto in the Douro is in its second released vintage. This is made using Bordeaux techniques, resulting in a style that is more structured than many Douro wines, exploiting ripe fruit with solid tannins, leavened by sweetness and sweet red fruits. The wood shows through on the finish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,29,"A hugely juicy wine, dominated by Touriga Nacional, leavened by dry tannins. It's big, ripe, with vivid red fruits giving spice and power. Immediately attractive now, it is likely to age well over the next 5–8 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,50,"An impressively powerful wine, with concentrated fruit from old vines. It packs dense tannins, layers flavors of ripe figs, plums and raisins, along with wood flavors. The quinta is close to Regua in the western part of the Douro vineyards, a region particularly well suited to powerful but still elegant table wines."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,12,"Floral, fresh aromas burst out of the glass in this green, crisp wine. There is a creamy element to it, probably from the Alvarinho in the blend, giving the wine some richness. But in the end, this is all about lightness, summer drinking with seafood."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,90,16,"This is impressive, both for Vinho Verde and or a cooperative wine. The Alvarinho grape shows its best here with richness, intensity and flavors of plums, pineapple and ripe pears. Imported by Tri-Vin Imports."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,90,11,"From Monsão, this is quintessential Alvarinho, ripe and full-bodied, with the typical apple skin structure and the hint of tropical fruits. Even though it is so ripe, it remains crisp and fresh. Imported by Aveleda Imports."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,90,15,"Provam is a grouping of 10 growers in the Monsão area. Citrus and green fruit flavors dominate this Alvarinho-based wine. Intensely flavored wine, dry and great for food. Imported by Admiral Wine Imports."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,83,16,"Seems a touch less than fully ripe, dominated by grassy-herbal notes and strawberry fruit. Some drying tannins on the finish contribute to that same impression, but it might be just the thing with rare burgers."
Portugal,White Blend,White,82,8,"Starts off with a bit of matchstick on the nose, then opens to reveal a fairly bland, innocuous white with a plump mouthfeel."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,10,"Soft and light, with good black plum and fig flavors. There's a touch of spice, but this is lively, juicy and fresh."
Portugal,Alicante Bouschet,Red,86,11,"It may be a second-rate grape in France, but in Portugal Alicante Bouschet has really come into its own. This is a ripe, smooth wine, with dark plum skin tannins, red peppers and intense concentrated spice. Drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,29,"This estate, managed by the Symington family, is a great Douro property by any standard. This hot 2003 vintage is properly big and dense, but the elegance and style of the estate shows through, with delicious ripe plum flavors over the new wood. Age this for at least 6 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,92,125,"From a single vineyard at Quinta do Crasto, this wine was fermented in open lagars. It is big, perfumed, packed with superripe fruit. It could almost be too much, but the spice, pepper and dense tannins are restrained by an edge of acidity. It promises long-term aging."
Portugal,Syrah,Red,87,17,"There are few Syrahs in Portugal—some in the Alentejo—but this comes from the coastal region of Bairrada. It shows all the rich, violet and black plum juice varietal character, very juicy. There is spice from wood, but this and the soft tannins meld easily into the rich fruit."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,89,15,"A finely balanced wine, creamy and smooth, with good dense flavors. Green plums, apple skins and ripe acidity blend well in this fresh wine. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,89,10,"This blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura comes from the former vineyard of a local nobleman. It is a great, ripe wine, packed with tropical fruits, only very slightly off-dry because of its richness. Imported by Admiral Wine Imports."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,89,20,"Here six months in wood have enhanced the fruit, rather than giving a toasty character. There are tropical, apricot flavors, while even in a lesser year like 2004, the flavors are rich and intense. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,89,13,"A 100% Alvarinho from this small, 34-acre estate near Monsão. This is a delicious, fresh wine, with great piercing acidity and bright pink grapefruit flavors. Imported by Grape Expectations (CA)."
Portugal,Malvasia Fina,White,82,16,"This medium-bodied white is a bit prickly and tough to like, with citrus pith aromas and largely neutral flavors that turn chalky and peppery on the finish."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,82,8,"Burmester's entry into the Douro table wine sweepstakes is a medium-bodied, somewhat leathery wine. Some glue and vinyl notes on the nose, strawberry and rhubarb notes on the palate, and a dry, dusty finish all make for a wine that's decent, nothing more."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,82,16,"A disappointing effort, the 2002 Boa Nova is rather light in color and already showing slight bricking at the rim. Earthy flavors of mushroom and cola are tinged with prune and caramel. A blend of Alicante Bouschet, Aragonês, Cabernet Sauvignon and Castelão."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,82,23,"Combines tobacco and baked fruit scents on the nose, then delivers flavors reminiscent of charred leather and cooked plums. Medium-bodied, with a supple, earth-and-tobacco finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,82,16,"Smells attractive enough, offering up chocolate, blackberry and spice aromas, but seems a bit thin and lacking in texture on the palate, finishing with some unintegrated alcohol. Imported by Vineyard Brands."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,82,13,"The Alentejo is a warm region, and this wine, in this vintage, seems to have gotten a bit too warm. The cherry fruit is a bit dulled and baked, but then there's enough acidity to bring it into some semblance of balance. Dusty and soft on the finish."
Portugal,Castelão,Red,86,10,"Palmela is the region just south of Lisbon, producing light, fresh wines that are both great values and great everyday drinking. The strawberry fruit flavors are immediately appealing, freshened by the acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,10,"A ripe, soft wine that represents great drinking value. The fruit is fresh and easy, with light tannins and acidity. This is juicy, full of red fruits and touched by a light element of wood."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,85,11,"A soft, lightly sweet style of rosé, flavored with strawberries and a touch of caramel. Fresh, and flavorful, with balancing acidity, this is a good apéritif wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,13,"Pink-colored, with flavors of soft caramel and sweet strawberry and just enough acidity to give some balance. It's easy, full in the mouth, bright and finally fresh."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,13,"Big and rich, this is a round and structured wine. It has great layers of ripe herbs, full black fruits and exotic spice to go over the dry tannins. The final flavors are rich, tarry, juicy as well as powerful."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,49,"The name refers to the big meander the Douro river takes around the quinta's vineyards, forming a long peninsula. Like its big brother, the quinta wine, this reflects the heat and the concentrated fruit that comes from this famed vineyard. Its tannins are almost impenetrable at this stage, deep and dry, needing several years of aging to reveal the solid, ripe dark, spicy flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,54,"The darkest, most impressive version of the Duas Quintas brand, this Reserva is made in the open lagars, from foot-trodden grapes in the tradition still used by major Port houses. It gives a ripe, sweet, almost Port-like character, but still firmed by structure and dusty tannins to go with the superripe plums."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,11,"Ripe, soft and fruity, with dense sweet fruit. The wine is approachable, an enticing mix of tannins, spice and coffee. With its fruity finish, the wine is sure to please. The quinta was owned by the local postman, and correio is the word for post in Portuguese."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,16,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Touriga Nacional, so called because producer Paulo Cunha and US importer Robert Kacher felt the Cabernet was new world in its contribution, while the Touriga was firmly in the old world. Very ripe and juicy, this wine is full of black fresh fruits, just underlined by a touch of dry tannin. There is an openness as well as a dry aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,89,11,"One of the most familiar brands of Vinho Verde in Portugal, with a production of 2.5 million bottles, this bone-dry, supremely crisp wine has apple and sharp pear flavors, and ripe andconcentrated, but very fresh fruit. Imported by Tri-Vin Imports."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,89,8,"One of the markers for Vinho Verde, this brand gets better and better. The 2005 is a new blend, with 10% of Alvarinho from the Aveleda estate. It is ripe and rich, with great solid full fruits in the mouth, tropical but with some citrus character. It's bone dry, with fine finishing acidity. Imported by Aveleda Imports."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,89,8,"This is serious Vinho Verde. It has all the fresh, crisp, acidic character but, because of the year, it is also full, ripe, with green apple skin flavors, green plums and intense fruit. Imported by RC Importers."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,89,12,"This is a 100% Alvarinho, perfumed with hints of honey and melon. It is a ripe, intense wine, dry but rich, showing a lemon tea character, a touch of spritz and fresh, dry finish. Imported by Evaton, Inc."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,20,"A firm wine, with dark chocolate and coffee flavors. The fruit flavors are  dark fig and stewed plums; there is a bitter edge to the tannins."
Portugal,Alfrocheiro,Red,85,11,"Normally grown in the Dão region, this grape needs poor soil to flourish. On its own, it makes a powerfully fruity wine packed with red fruits and some flavors of dark chocolate. The acidity is intense, and needs another few months to settle down."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,9,"Crisp apples, touched with some sweetness, but finely clean and fresh, this is a great apéritif style of Vinho Verde, finishing with just a sparkle. Screwcap."
Portugal,Castelão,Red,90,14,"Just turning in color, a wine that is beginning to mature. It has leathery texture over spice, ripe tannins and flavors of red fruit jelly. There is a bitter coffee character that melds easily into the tannins. It is a delicious wine, balanced and made for food."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,100,"The fine, ripe, structured character of Touriga Nacional is well evident here. It may be big in alcohol, but the wine wears that easily, going more for fresh tannins and acidity, for black currant and dark plum flavors and smooth, vanilla flavors from the French wood aging."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,91,17,"Structured, rich, but also with good fresh acidity, this is one of the best wines in the Quinta do Portal range. It has lively, vibrant red fruit, along with dry tannins, some vanilla from wood aging. Great acidity in the aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,23,"From Aliança's Alentejo Terrugem vineyard, this dense, tannin-packed wine has powerful flavors of dark fruits, a very dry backbone and layer upon layer of tarry, smoky tastes. Initially it overwhelms with its richness, but that softens and the acidity gives the wine a lifted vibrancy."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,11,"A fresh, ripe red wine, with spice and sweet fruit. There is a simple, attractive juicy character, accompanied by soft tannins. The fruit is fresh and berry-flavored, just brushed by wood."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,88,9,"Aveleda's more traditional Vinho Verde is still perfectly fresh, with crisp green plum and grapefruit flavors. A blend of Trajadura and Loureiro, it is fresh but full-bodied with good intensity of fruit. Imported by Aveleda Imports."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,12,"A full wine, balanced with an attractive citrus character and some creamy texture. There is also an edge of tannin that makes it a good, fresh, food wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,60,"The Quinta da Leda is high up the Douro, in the remote regions of Douro Superior. This 2004 shows the concentration of the fruit in the dark tannins, the toasty new wood and the ripe dark plum fruits. It is smooth enough to drink now, but the tannins promise 5–6 years aging."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,40,"Old vines in this case means 70-year-old vines. Featuring blackberry fruit flavors, along with plums, sweet and rich, this shows a dense, herbal character, dry tannins, lifted by acidity to finish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,25,"A rare Portuguese Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend, made with the involvement of Bordeaux winemaker Pascal Chatonnet, working with Caves Aliança's winemaker Francisco Antunes. Does it work? Yes, as a delicious curiosity. There is no connection with Portugal, but there is smooth new wood, and some pepper from alcohol. Then tannins are dry, the fruit is very ripe and very rich."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,88,15,"This small estate bottling is an attractive, full-bodied wine, ripe, with a touch of tropical fruit flavors. Fine, clean and fresh. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc."
Portugal,Fernão Pires,White,86,9,"Full, soft wine, with fruit that is rich and gentle. The acidity is what keeps this broad wine together. The green apple and white berry fruits add texture, with just a touch of spice."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,70,"Lovely, ripe, mature fruit underlies great toffee richness, a serious amount of wood tannin and acidity. The flavors are of old caramel and dark brown sugar. This is an impressive wine that balances age with continuing freshness."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,6,"A success in the sweeter Vinho Verde category. There is pleasant softness, flavors of green berries, grapefruit with sugar and freshness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,90,18,"This joint venture between the inspired winemaker Domingos Soares Franco and Cristiano van Zeller produces fascinatingly idiosyncratic wines. Big and bold, but then lean and tannic, with sunshine-filled fruit over dark tannins. Consumers wanting an action-packed wine, needing time to come together (when it will be superb), should go for this."
Portugal,Cabernet Sauvignon,Red,89,10,"The 15th century Quinta de Pancas, north of Lisbon, produces this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon wine. It has initially lean tannins, but the fruit has spice, black currant fruits and a tight line in wood and final sweetness. For aging."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,10,"A full-bodied, ripe wine from the Dão. It has the classic minerality of the region, as well as solid fruit, dark tannins and spice. The combination of juicy sweetness and firm, dry tannins is very successful."
Portugal,Arinto,White,86,7,"The brand Bucellas (with two “l”s) has been made by Caves Velhas for years. It remains a light, fresh, crisp wine, all white berry fruits, green plums and lively acidity. A great seafood wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,25,"A well-balanced wine, bringing both rich fruit and sweet tannins to go with dense concentration. There is ripeness from black jam and sweet jelly, followed by a good core of dryness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,32,"A classic Portuguese blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Franca, this is a medium-bodied wine with good structure and presence of tannin. Bright fruit flavors of red currant, cherry and strawberry abound on the palate, finishing fresh and clean."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,14,"The high vineyards of inland eastern Portugal gives a wine that is initially austere, tasting very much of its rock terroir, cool and elegant. The fruit is very direct, fresh and juicy, with the tannins a strong presence. The final acidity is a cool burst."
Portugal,Tinta Roriz,Red,86,8,"TR stands for Tinta Roriz, the dominant grape in this blended wine (with Touriga Nacional). It is smooth, polished, with a spice and mint character, juicy and fruity. The tannins may be dry, but they in no way inhibit the exuberant fruit."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,10,"A bright, tight, citrus-flavored wine, with a great mineral streak over fresh, creamy acidity. There are lovely wafts of fresh apple juice. A delicious wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,53,"A wine that spent 14 years in wood to give the deep gold color, the bitter marmalade flavors that are tightened by old wood. This is unctuous in its texture, but bright in its flavor. Ready to drink."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,83,8,"An easy, fresh, slightly sparkling wine with pleasant, soft, lightly sweet fruit flavors. It is clean, a great apéritif for a summer's day."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,7,"On paper, this is an interesting blend of Aragonez and Cabernet; however, this fruity wine is much simpler than that. There is a spice element that adds some complexity, but the palate concentrates mainly on red fruits and layered acidity. Drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,12,"A soft, simple wine, the tannins set the pace, but the fruit doesn't quite follow. It is relatively light, with some red fruits and good acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,12,"Very dense tannins dominate big ripe blackberry jam flavors. The wine is hugely rich, but sustains itself by the structure which is dry, dusty tannin-dominated, with just a hint of fruit. To finish, there are juicy, fresh flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,38,"The Olazabal/Ferreira family owns two Douro quintas, this and Vale Meão, high up-river. Vallado is in a cooler, wetter climate, and produces elegant wines, in a modern, smooth style. Based on one of the lesser Port grapes, the Sousão, this is full of black currant fruits and new wood flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,17,"Spicy, toasty, full-bodied and fruity, this is a wine that is packed with plums, fresh red fruits, and a great burst of ripe acidity. Delicious and very accessible."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,9,"In keeping with the austerity of the Dão landscape, this is a taut, mineral-inspired wine, with acidity that sweeps over the black berry fruit. The tannins give a firm core of dryness, but that acidity freshness keeps everything vivid and lively."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,60,"There are big tannins here on this rich, powerful wine, warm and ripe. There is a dry core, giving a dark, youthful herbal character, and the tannins along with final acidity. Although it is ready to drink, it also promises many years of aging."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,82,7,"Somewhat lean, this has a tart, grapefruit character that sits awkwardly with the otherwise fresh, green fruit character. Hard-edged."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,32,"The two Ramos-Pinto quintas of Ervamoira and Bons Ares provide contrasting fruit—the hot, dry conditions of Ervamoira and the more temperate climate of Bons Ares. Together, with this coffee and oak flavored wine, built upon ripe fruits, they make an impressive combination of dark, spicy flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,11,"A blend of Baga and Merlot, the Baga giving the tight juiciness, the Merlot rounding the wine out. The wine is fresh, fruity, packed with red berries, with an herbal edge and spice from wood."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,25,"Initially it seems very dry, but there is freshness as well. The wine has a sweet, jelly core, with soft tannins, well balanced. Raisins and black figs dominate, with the aftertaste bringing a firming of tannins and structure. Powerful and impressive."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,22,"With its dense color and sweet fruits, this is wine that works well, with a great rich, soft texture. There is a concentrated juicy and jammy character, with final approachable spice and acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,22,"On the dry side, typical of Dow's, a wine with jellied fruits kept behind firm, young tannins. The wine has definite acidity, bracketing the tannins and dark fruits. The perfumed aftertaste is fresh, but still keeping that dry core."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,81,8,"The familiar rosé Lancers is all about crushed strawberries with a touch of sugar. There is a light structure, but the attractive light pink color and the fresh fruit all work together. Screwcap."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,13,"Ramos-Pinto's benchmark wine, a classic in the Douro, made from the two quintas of Ervamoira and Bons Ares, is as good as ever. It is firm but but not powerful, with black fruits, freshened by acidity, leaving a wine that is a touch mineral."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,20,"From Ferreira's own vineyards in the Douro, this smooth, ripe, wood laden wine is spicy, with blackberry fruits, a shot of dark tannins, and fresh, juicy acidity. Age for another 2–3 years before drinking."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,86,8,"Delicious, almost dry rosé, with spice, sweet strawberries and a texture of bright berry skins. There is some depth here, flavors that go right through the wine, finishing with vivid acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,10,"A lively, fresh wine, with crisp green fruits and vivid acidity. There are pineapple and orange zest flavors. This is a fresh, modern white wine, finishing cleanly with a delicious lime juice character."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,159,"This is definitely old, an acquired taste perhaps, the wine showing high wood acidity, with a tight character. Any fruit has gone, leaving pure acidity and a very mature texture."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,25,"Bottled unfiltered (which means there is a sediment in the bottle), this is a fine wine, on the dry side, with firm tannins, fresh acidity and flavors of dried fruits. It has a solid, possibly ageworthy character."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,35,"Delicious sweet raisin and mulled wine fruit, full of herbs and nutmeg spice. This is a ripe wine, but too heavy, showing some austerity, but no sign of tiring."
Portugal,Port,Red,95,467,"Perfectly mature, this Port's tannins have softened over the past 40-plus years, leaving it lushly textured and displaying rich fig and chocolate flavors. Finishes long, picking up a touch of almond to go with the fig, flavors Symington calls “Dow's hallmarks.” Drink now–2015, longer if you prefer very mature wines."
Portugal,Port,Red,94,62,"A powerhouse of a wine that goes from densely rich to massive without a pause. The ripe fruit, the dark, heavy tannins, the black plum and fig flavors, all come from the terroir of this great vineyard."
Portugal,Port,Red,94,49,"In the Fonseca tradition, this is a hugely rich wine, very dense. It is not all weight, with excellently integrated firm tannins and a range of complex flavors, from nuts and berry fruits to full frontal ripeness. There is some dryness to finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,94,94,"Mouthfilling and round, without any sharp edges, but this wine remains extremely firm and dense, with several decades of life ahead of it. Dried fig, chocolate and black licorice flavors only hint at what lies ahead."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,88,20,"A huge wine, full of soft fruit. The layers of tannins sit gently on the plum and cassis fruits, lifted by acidity. If it wasn't 15.5%, this would be impressive, but the high alcohol makes the wine very Port-like, giving an extra layer of pepper from the alcohol."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,8,"Delicious citrus and grape juice aromas, with a vivid, lively dry style that explodes with white fruit and lime flavors. The wine is a great apéritif, or with shellfish."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,8,"A blend of Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional, crisply flavored with raspberries and fresh acidity. A dry rosé, which finishes with a bright lift."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,18,"Firm, concentrated fruit and dusty tannins. The wine has acidity, freshness and attractive berry and fresh fruit flavors. Fine, vivid acidity completes a harmonious wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,25,"Initially the tannins dominate, but then ripe, sweet jelly and juicy fruit shows through, giving the wine its main character. There is some firm tannin, but the wine enjoys generous sweetness."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,66,"As ever, Vesuvio is packed with its generous, opulent ripe fruit, showing richness, dense flavors, layers of jam and sweetness with a hint of caramel flavors. This is a Port for indulgence, ripe, rich and packed with flavor."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,83,"A powerhouse, but one that shows a certain degree of lushness to its robust blackberry and mint flavors. Finishes long and minerally, bolstered by slightly drying tannins. Should be more approachable by 2015 and last for three decades beyond that."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,50,"A finely structured, impressively elegant wine, packed with dark fruit skin flavors, heavy with tannins and delicious perfumed fruit. While it is rich, it is also dry, suggesting excellent aging potential."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,70,"Dense, dusty, structured, tannic, dry wine, that promises aging potential. It is definitely young, dark with plum skin fruits, power and richness, that go along with excellent acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,14,"A hugely rich wine, packed with dried fruit flavors and spice from aging in American oak. This is a dense blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira and Cabernet Sauvignon, merging well together, the Cabernet giving structure, the other grapes the rich, smooth texture and black fruits."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,9,"An exotic blend including Pinot Noir and Merlot along with Portuguese varieties, taking its name from two local villages with saints' names. It has acidity and an awkward bitter edge, with tough black fruits. Maybe it needs time for the wine to soften and meld with the tight acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,9,"The perfect summer apéritif, this light, fresh, crisp wine tastes just drier than previous vintages, allowing the apple and lemon fruits to shine even more. It has a tight, taut aftertaste, leaving the mouth clean and refreshed. Screwcap."
Portugal,Chardonnay,White,85,13,"Creamy, green plum- and wood-flavored Chardonnay, clean, somewhat anonymous. Hints of citrus and acidity help keep the wine fresh, giving a final, easy crisp finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,25,"A solid, chunky wine, its tannins giving a tight edge of dryness. Acidity and really juicy fruit make the wine accessible, with great dried raisins coming through strongly and deliciously."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,15,"Densely tannic wine, certainly not ready to drink, with dusty tannins over ripe fruit, powered by a dry core of minerality. The wine is solid, with structure first and rich fruit after."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,26,"A full-bodied wine, showing the richness and super-ripe grapes of 2003. It is soft, with dusty tannins showing through the ripe damsons and almost jammy character. It's all well in balance."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,90,"Approachable now, but capable of further positive evolution, the 1980 is lush and supple, with abundant chocolate and dried-spice flavors and a long, warming finish. Drink now–2025."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,80,"A rounded, ripe, sweet wine, touched with caramel and dry figs. There's generous, rich fruit, and a feeling of warmth from spice and dark plums. Ripe, leavened with acidity for aging."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,75,"Vineyards don't get more remote than Ervamoira, in the heart of the Côa national park of prehistoric wall drawings. It's dry here, and that's evident from the dusty tannins, firm dark black fruits, and considerable aging potential."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,8,"A firm, dry lean wine, with some tough tannins, but also with great red fruits and good freshness. This young Dão, with its blend of Tinta Roriz, Jaen and Touriga Nacional, is likely to develop, with its tannins and acidity softening. At the moment, freshness is the key."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,20,"A wine that relies on delicious primary fruit flavors, fresh and lively, with acidity, soft but typically dry Douro tannins and red fruit flavors. A delicious, fresh wine."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,7,"A low-alcohol (9.5%), apéritif style of Vinho Verde, which certainly has some sweetness, but which also balances it with plenty of  crisp, green fruit flavors. Imported by Admiral Wine Imports."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,10,"A crisp, fresh white wine, with clean acidity and a forward, easy lemon and melon character, with a hint of honey from the Malvasia Fina grapes in the blend."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,22,"Very ripe young fruit, a damson and sweet plum juice flavor, with a touch of stalkiness as well as richness. The wine bursts with fruit, although finally quite dry, with a complex, dark texture."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,50,"Soft in texture yet mouthcoating in its intensity, this is a honeyed, nutty wine filled with dried fruit, toffee and almond butter aromas and flavors. Like all tawnies, it won't improve with bottle age, so drink this while your young vintage Ports hog the cellar space."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,45,"A dry, structured wine, firm and with tannic, concentrated fruit. Spirit and acidity are both evident, but with its dark, brooding style this is an impressive return to form by Croft."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,87,13,"Zingy, touched with honey and ripe, soft fruits. Flavors of green plum, thyme and lime gives this lift and a light, white aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,85,7,"This relatively dry style is crisp, fresh and acidic. The name “Lagosta” means “lobster,” and this would be a great seafood accompaniment. Imported by Admiral Wine Imports."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,85,12,"As it should be from the year and the grape, this is a full-bodied wine,  with some good green plum flavors. But its intensity of flavor is spoiled by the soft, lightly sugary aftertaste. Imported by Signature Imports."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,9,"Although it is a sweeter style, this is much fresher than the dry vinho verde from this huge cooperative. There is some crispness, but the soft aftertaste gives the sugar away."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,8,"Soft, ripe wine, with easy flavors of juicy black berries, fresh acidity and sweet tannins. A wine with only a hint of dryness, which is ready to drink."
Portugal,Bical,White,85,9,"Initially a tightly textured, apple and pear skin flavored wine. As it opens up, it shows creamy, fresh fruit, with pear and white currant freshness, finished with green walnuts and a burst of acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,7,"This is a featherlight red, full of berries and bright acidity, but with a texture that just coats the palate. This is one of those rare reds that works as an apéritif, fresh, clean and fruity. Screwcap."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,13,"Full-bodied, soft wine, with pleasant, open flavors of melon, lime and ripe white figs. There is sweetness, emphasizing the softness of the wine. Pleasant and drinkable now."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,7,"This familiar brand of Vinho Verde has long been in a sweeter style. But this latest vintage seems to have brought out the fresh, crisp fruits, and pushed back the sweetness. The result is a delicious summer apéritif style that leaves a clean, light taste in the mouth."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,13,"A deliciously rich, sweet and youthfully fruity wine that has an opulent feel to it. There is a juicy element, with fresh acidity, but most of the character comes from the ripe fruit, the jelly character and the sweet tannins. It needs more bottle age."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,25,"A wine that has the characteristic 2004 perfume character, with vanilla, almost opulent fruits and layers of nutmeg. There are blackberry and apple pie flavors and firm, dry tannins. Bottled unfiltered, suggesting aging potential."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,22,"This fine wine is still on the young side, with tannins dominating fruit, followed by acidity and cranberry juice character. It is dry, with just a touch of sweetness and a dry, tight aftertaste. This needs some bottle age—two years at least."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,52,"Soft, perfumed wine, with a rich, full-bodied style that goes towards dry. At this stage, the spirit is somewhat obvious, but that is a sign of youth, and the wine will develop power and strength over the next several years."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,47,"This is a superlative vineyard, and this wine shows its true character, a big, hearty wine, but one with a structured core of mineral, rich fruits and dark tannins. With its concentration, expect it to age well over 10 years and more."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,50,"Structured, complex wine that is only just beginning to hint at considerable depth of powerful, rich flavors. The structure is dry, a little lean, but with dense tannins. The fruit, rich plums and stone fruits is just coming through. Age for 10 years."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,13,"At three years, Ramos-Pinto's branded Adriano (named after the founder of the company) is at its best. This 2004 vintage is big-hearted, with bitter chocolate and blackberry fruits, as well as generous tannins. Good, dry structure and fresh acidity complete a rounded picture."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,20,"Vallado's simplest wine is all big, black, crisp fruit leaping out of the glass. While it is not light, it certainly has a lilt and freshness to it, despite the dry tannins which underlie the flavors. Herbs and spices add to the pleasure."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,7,"A light, flowery style of wine, with a touch of almonds and crisp, clean, lightly sweet fruit. At 9% alcohol this is a good summer quaff."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,8,"A tight, freshly acid wine, with stalkiness but also good juicy fruit. There is a green pepper element, leaving a wine that is light, simple."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,22,"Very raisiny, the fresh fruit soft and juicy. Cranberry and spice flavors give a purity of berry fruits and sweet acidity. It is very accessible, with all the elements well in place."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,30,"This is drier than some 10-year-old Tawnys, showing a taste of wood, with acidity and the fig and raisin flavors behind the mature flavors. This is all suggests that much of the wine in the blend is older than 10 years, giving extra richness and depth of flavor."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,55,"Dark in color, the wine has very rich fruit flavors spiced with cinnamon, tasting like Christmas coffee, the tannins firm, with a dry structure. Black plum skins dominate."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,19,"A ripe, fresh fruity wine, with richness from black plums, but also plenty of bright acidity. The wine is soft, the tannins hiding behind the rich fruit."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,60,"A classic, structured, well-shaped Port with its attractive dry tannins and firm, dark berry fruit. There's excellent balance between the fruit and the sweet spirit character, which goes right through this serious wine."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,11,"Beefy, burly wine, shot through with dry Dão tannins, dry and firm. The fruit is juicy, lightly rustic, with high acidity coming through its rich meat gravy flavors."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,6,"A fresh, uncomplicated wine, made and sold in large quantities. There is sweetness, along with clean, easy lemon fruits and a touch of acidity. Don't think, drink."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,8,"A soft wine, creamy and ripe. The flavors are open, with white fruits, green plums, a baked apple character. There is acidity, but with the gentle, ripe fruit, this blends in easily. For early drinking."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,10,"A soft, clean, fruity wine, with spice and a fresh, aromatic character. The lemon and white fruit flavors are in an easy, apéritif style, with a lightly sweet aftertaste."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,84,13,"A fresh, bone-dry rosé, packed with acidity, red currants and a touch of caramel. The wine is light, summery, good for apéritif or food."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,84,8,"It takes a while for the taste of this light, fresh white to come through. Then, it is soft, creamy textured, flavored with pear juice and lemon zest. It is simple, easy, cleanly made."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,8,"A fresh, slightly sweet rosé, that keeps crispness through its bright, breezy strawberry flavors. The wine is soft, crisp, clean, a summer rosé."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,26,"A rich, extravagantly spicy wine, the fruit showing sweet raisins and dried figs. The tannins are soft and generous, with good ripe fruit. This is an open, soft wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,15,"A ripe wine, touched with caramel, plenty of spice and acidity as well as a tight, tannic edge. The start is sweet, but the wine soon veers drier, leaving acidity as well as the firmest tannins."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,86,13,"A fresh, lively, citrus-flavored wine with touches of white peaches and a soft structure. Give this 6 months in bottle for the freshness to peak."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,13,"A structured, ripe wine, leavened with a base of dry tannins. It is full of ripe blueberry fruit flavors and juicy freshness. A little stalky, but easy, soft and ready to drink."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,83,9,"A simple, rather earthy, dry style of vinho verde, a blend of Loureiro, Trajadura and Pederna. It's somewhat reductive, which rather spoils the freshness."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,82,8,"The estate wine from Vila Verde which is in Lousada in the southern Vinho Verde region. It is a simple wine, fresh, but just too lightweight and bland."
Portugal,Portuguese White,White,82,6,"The standard style of inexpensive Vinho Verde, this is a simple wine, clean, but with layers of sugar to coat and mask the fresh, crisp acidity."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,84,11,"Although it lacks the creamy crispness of Alavarinho from Vinho Verde, this certainly has the right lemon and cantaloup melon flavors. There is a lift and freshness to it, aided by the tight pear skin structure. The finish is a letdown, though, with a cardboard and green pea character."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,6,"Soft and fruity, the fruit light, flavored with plum jelly and dried fruits. The wine is soft, somewhat unfocused, the tannins giving some dryness, but leaving a feeling of old-fashioned over-ripe fruits."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,26,"An austere wine with a stalky character, showing firm tannins and a strong mineral character of Douro schist. It is like a sweet table wine, spiced and structured, needing to age."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,25,"A firm, dry tannic wine, with a good dense structure. The fruit shows its edgy side, with fruit skins and fruit tannins. This has some aging potential—perhaps 4–5 years."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,54,"Fruity, lacking the power of some vintages of Vargellas, but more than making up with richness, sweetness and delicious violet perfumes. There is some cranberry jelly flavor, an edge of dryness and firmness in the fruit, but it's more about ripeness."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,57,"From a vineyard opposite Quinta do Vesuvio, high up the Douro, this Symington-owned property has produced a rich, sweet 2004, with a soft tannic structure, layered with a lightly spirit edge. It's a big mouthful of ripe fruit."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,86,10,"This is one of Portugal's big brands. Soft, easy and juicy, this has  just a touch of dryness and great, fresh aftertaste."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,8,"A fruity, juicy wine, all ripe raspberries and red plum skins. It is fresh, with a layer of dry tannins, but more fruit than structure."
Portugal,Fernão Pires,White,83,9,"A very soft, open style of wine. It has ripe white pear and spice flavors, but everything is muted. It is clean, fresh, with some lemon flavors just creeping in finally."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,20,"Starts with aromas of dried cherries, a slight nuttiness and hints of smoke. Elegant and smooth in the mouth, its lovely nutty flavors buffered by dried cherries and honey. Finishes long, just a touch on the tart side."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,21,"W & J Graham makes one of the best-known Reserve Port brands. And a great wine it is, too. It is soft, but there are tannins. It is fruity, but there is good concentration. And with its flavors of ripe black figs and dark chocolate, it is an immediately appealing wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,18,"A well-balanced Port from master winemaker Dirk Niepoort. It is soft, with delicate flavors of black cherries, and young, fresh fruit. In keeping with what a Reserve Port should be, this is easy to drink, just hinting at a tannic structure."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,11,"This is the second wine of the Rothschild-owned Quinta do Carmo. It is soft and supple with dry tannins and fresh, juicy fruit flavors. The tannins suggest it could age, but it is not a complex wine and is good to drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,10,"A big round, juicy wine which is a perfect barbecue wine. Packed with berry and herbal flavors, it is soft, ripe, with a light layer of tannins. From a blend of local grapes, this is ready to drink now."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,9,"This wine starts off with distinctive and promising aromas of smoked and cured meats and tea leaves, but it falls off a bit on the palate, turning lean and cranberryish."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,30,"Caramelly and sweet, without the usual complexity or elegance that are Dow's hallmarks. Smoother and silkier than run-of-the-mill tawnies, but a disappointing effort given the house's fine track record."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,23,"This is a dense, chocolaty and plummy wine, on the full-bodied side, with modest tannins to provide balance. A bit chunky, but satisfying, with bold, fleshy flavors and hints of caramel."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,25,"Light in body, which contributes to this wine's sense of being easy to drink. Coffee and caramel flavors mix creamily on the supple palate, finishing with elegant flourishes of nuts."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,28,"This is a structured style of Port, which hangs together well, with its ripe fruit and flavors of tar, rosewater and black figs. The tannins and the structure blend combine with sweetness to give an attractive balanced wine. The quinta of la Rosa, owned by the Bergqvist family, is perched dramatically on the north bank of the Douro close to Pinhão."
Portugal,Madeira Blend,Red,88,25,"Plump and sweet, this single-vintage Madeira boasts slightly nutty aromas allied to scents of dried figs and dates. The sweet dried-fruit and Christmas-spice flavors come on strong on the palate, balanced by tangy acids on the long finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,20,"One of the big brands in Reserve Ports, Bin 27 is long and well established. So it's good to report that it is great wine, with sweetness and balancing acidity and fruit. Soft and juicy it is ready to drink, but there are structure and flavors of dried raisins to give it some aging potential."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,17,"Standard, simple Port, with flavors of dates, blackberry jam and a hint of mint or straw. Good balance for a a wine in his category."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,12,"Supple and fruity, this is a decent value in basic Port. Prune and plum flavors show a hint of raisining, but it finishes balanced and smooth."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,12,"A fruity quaff, with aromas of mixed berries and cotton candy, flavors that are similarly simple. The mixed berries turn tart and piquant on the finish. A blend of Aragonês (Tempranillo) and Trincadeira."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,97,"A good choice for current consumption, the 1985 Dow's shows a touch of bricking to go along with developed aromas of cedar, clove and cinnamon. Cherry, plum, fennel and dried spice notes finish with a hint of toffee. Drink now–2015."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,17,"Now under the same ownership as Taylor and Ferreira, Croft Ports have taken on a new lease of life. This is a classic Port from a classic name, with its ripe fruit and structure. It has flavors of dried raisins, figs and dark chocolate, along with firm, dusty tannins and a dry aftertaste."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,19,"A single quinta Reserva, which is young and seems to have the potential to age in bottle. The aromas are fresh and lightly stalky. It is well-made and fruity with layers of tannins along with firm fruit flavors. It would be worth buying this now and keeping it until the end of the year."
Portugal,Encruzado,White,87,14,"An unique dessert wine, this is a late-harvest effort made from Encruzado grapes. Its deep golden color and scents of burnt orange peel and honey lead into a wine that's not very sweet--and so best paired with foie gras or a cheese course. Traces of nuts, oranges and honey finish a bit short."
Portugal,Port,Red,83,12,"Slightly hot, this chunky, full-bodied tawny reveals flavors of earth and prune. Hints of caramel and maple syrup on the finish, but also a slightly bitter note of scorched earth."
Portugal,Port,Red,83,17,"A sweet, slightly spirity Port that lacks any real depth or complexity, yet still provides a modicum of pleasure in its sugary, cooked-fruit flavors of prunes, dates and raisins."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,80,"Soft, superripe wine, with layers of sweet black figs and chocolate. This is almost like a Porty Zinfandel in its richness. There are tannins there, but they seem lost in this riot of sweet fruit."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,55,"On the outside this is all soft, generous round fruit. In the core, though, there is a strong acid, perfumed fruit character, which suggests aging potential. Now the two components need to come together."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,35,"Interesting contrast to the 20 Years Old from the same house, yielding similar walnut and caramel scents and also a touch of spirit on the nose. But quite different in the mouth, where it is blockier and more intense, with robust berry flavors. Finishes a little coarse and rustic."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,84,"One of Portugal's priciest table wines, this vintage boasts cherry and plum aromas that just don't seem all that intense, followed by bright cherry flavors accented by modest cedar. The long finish is evidence of its quality, but it turns astringent and one wonders whether the fruit will outlast the tannins."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,18,"With its dried raisin aromas and fresh, sweet, fruity character, this is a great example of Reserve Ports. It has a touch of tannin to go with the soft fruits, and flavors of ripe black figs and dark plums. First Estate is produced at Taylor Fladgate's original vineyard at Regua, which was bought in 1744."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,14,"With its well-integrated scents of cedar, plum and tobacco, this is a medium-weight wine whose hallmark is its balance. Vanilla and dried spices meld nicely with cherry and plum fruit, finishing smooth, with modest tannins. Drink now-2008."
Portugal,White Port,White,88,14,"We don't see much white Port in this country, but in Portugal it's often served as an apéritif. This is a fine example, a little sweet but also possessing bracing acidity for balance. Mouthwatering aromas and flavors run toward nuts and stone fruits, with a hint of honey."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,55,"From a small parcel of old vines, this wine is dense, very firm and closed. It is in a dry style, layering richness rather than sweetness, with solid black fruit. Give this wine at least 10 years."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,17,"Not an intense or concentrated wine, perhaps, but this Reserve Port from Churchill's is well balanced and finely structured. There are flavors of green figs that give it freshness, and a dry aftertaste. A slight stalky flavor is the only off note."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,28,"Situated in the heart of the Pinhão Valley, Estanho began to produce good vintage Port in the 1990s. This 1996 shows the style well. Big and ripe, quite dry with acidity and solid tannins, it is built for long aging."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,37,"This deliciously nutty tawny has old wood and concentrated flavors. They balance against fresh, sweet fruit and coffee flavors, along with some acidity and elegance."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,14,"Traditional unfiltered LBV, which has richness and concentration. Flavors of raisins and ripe, fresh fruit suggest this will evolve in the bottle over the next four or five years."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,15,"A big chocolaty wine, packed with intense, almost overpowering ripe fruit. Dark cocoa flavors and big black, jammy fruit leave very little to the imagination, and make it one-dimensional. But for those who like power, here it is."
Portugal,Madeira Blend,Red,86,15,"Amber-colored, with a green tinge to the rim, this is a medium-weight, not-terribly-sweet Madeira imbued with flavors of walnuts and dried figs. Lots of acidity on the finish."
Portugal,White Blend,White,86,9,"Very nice Vinho Verde, with fresh, green apple and lime aromas and a clean, crisp finish. Maybe a little fuller and plumper than typical, but still balanced, with no shortage of apple and citrus fruit."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,17,"One of the most familiar of Reserve Port brands, this is a fruity, soft wine, which seems to have aging potential as well as present drinking pleasure. The flavors are open, generous, easy, with just a touch of tannin to give it structure. A definite success."
Portugal,Muscat,White,85,13,"Immediately striking, with bold musk and floral aromas that burst from the glass. Ripe, expansive melon and spice notes on the palate. Full-bodied and soft; not as refreshing as some vintages, but still a nice way to start a meal. Drink now."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,18,"Freshness and fruitiness are the hallmarks of this wine, from French-owned Noval. It is easy and simple, but some herbal flavors add an edge of interest and there is structure as well. The bitter aftertaste spoils the rest of the wine."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,88,40,"This is a big, burly wine that needs some time to come into its own. Right now, the nose is way ahead of the palate, boasting smoky, herbal complexity layered over toast and blackberries, while the flavors are harder to read, being dominated by wood. A few years of cellaring should see the oak flavors integrating more with the underlying berries. Try in 2007."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,35,"This great quinta is owned by the Ferreira family and was the former home of the legendary table wine, Barca Velha. This 2001 is a great example of the power of the wines from this sun-baked vineyard. Young black fruits are balanced with perfumes and tarry flavors. It's dark, intense and likely to be long lasting."
Portugal,Aragonês,Red,87,45,"Clearly made with lofty aims, this wine displays great intensity. The aromas of fresh-sawn wood and vanilla are nearly overpowering, while the fruit is concentrated and plummy, with a large dose of tannins that dry out the finish. Give it a few years to settle down and it will be more approachable and hopefully more complex as well."
Portugal,Alvarinho,White,87,15,"Pricey for a Vinho Verde, but one of the best we've tasted on this side of the Atlantic. It's lean and minerally, with hints of green apple, lime and fresh fennel. Finishes long and crisp, with a mineral note that lingers gracefully."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,87,22,"Richly fruity, with aromas of raspberries and cherries, joined by leathery complexities and a hint of vanilla. This is a fresh, easy-drinking wine with enough crispness and tannic structure to stand up to roast pork. Picks up intriguing smoky, meaty notes on the finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,60,"Surprisingly light and soft, for a Dow Port, this shows sweet fruit with a super-ripe edge. In the medium-term, this will be a pleasant, ripe vintage, but it's not likely to age."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,54,"A joint venture with the van Zeller and Symington families, this is a surprisingly airy, light wine which seems to miss weight and depth. Sweetness, black figs, lean."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,16,"This fresh, fruity wine comes from one of the Symington Group's second labels, one which often impresses by its quality. This Port is herbal, with chocolate flavors, black fruits and a good, clean, dry aftertaste."
Portugal,Arinto,White,85,9,"Lime and chalk dust aromas ease into flavors of green apples and minerals. Finishes with mild citrus flavors that seem a bit softer than usual for this wine, giving it an atypically plump mouthfeel."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,14,"Starts with dusty earth scents alongside black plums, then develops flavors of chocolate and earth as well. Supple and fleshy, with little in the way of tannin, just a slightly tart edge to the finish to keep things in balance."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,50,"Already throwing considerable sediment and possessed of a creamy, supple mouthfeel, this is a vintage Port that should probably be consumed young. Enjoy its lush blueberry fruit, chocolate and spice complexity over the next 10 years. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,60,"Still in the flush of youth, this creamy-textured vintage Port strikes all the right notes, from complex aromas to powerful flavors. Blackberry, plum and earth notes finish long, buttressed by supple tannins. Based on the rapid maturation of the 2001 and 2002, drink this one from 2010-2020."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,14,"Cherry and chocolate flavors abound in this rather simple LBV. It's clean and well made, just doesn't show much depth or complexity, finishing on a tart note."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,14,"Earthy and a bit simple, with modest dried-fruit flavors and hints of candied orange peel. Lacks concentration, making it seem a little warm on the finish, but it's a solid performer in its class."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,19,"Roederer-Champagne owned Ramos Pinto has produced a soft, easy and ripe Reserve. Aromas of cistus flowers are off-putting, but the flavors of sweet milk chocolate are attractive. It just lacks structure."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,51,"Smells a bit underripe, with weedy, green notes that ride atop sour cherries. Tart and sour-tasting, yet it does pick up an intriguing licorice note on the finish. Not bad, but not worthy of its reputation."
Portugal,Port,Red,97,80,"A prodigious effort from a small house that's becoming one of the Douro's best. The fruit is massive; huge and inky and filled with blackberries and chocolate. Yet for all its size, it finishes with finesse-filled layers of flavor that fold in mint and black pepper notes."
Portugal,Port,Red,95,65,"One of the vintage's standouts, the 2000 Quinta do Noval is incredibly rich and intense, with a density that made me think I should reach for a spoon. Chocoate and coffee, prune and date aromas; plum cake flavors. Despite the richness, there is a superb backbone of acidity and ripe tannins that suggests peak maturity is probably two decades or more away."
Portugal,Port,Red,83,17,"The wine is perfumed with violets and a touch of nutmeg, but that is counterbalanced by its stalkiness. To taste, it is soft, but rather green and lightweight. It is pleasant enough, but doesn't have much character."
Portugal,Port,Red,83,17,"A disappointing wine from such a distinguished name, spoilt by greenness, and lacking richness or depth. It certainly tastes young, so it could develop but in weight it feels almost like a table wine, not a Port."
Portugal,Port,Red,83,15,"A pleasant, straightforward aromatic wine which is given a dark side by herbs and a slight touch of bitterness. Eucalyptus and stalkiness don't quite come together."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,82,"Perhaps the best young Churchill's I've tasted, the 2000 blends complexity with structure to create an eminently ageable Port. For fruit lovers, there's crushed berries and plums, but notes of dried spices and earth add depth. Estimated maturity: 2020–2050."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,93,65,"Made from grapes that used to go into Barca Velha, Portugal's most-storied table red, this wine represents the New Wave of Douro wines. It's inky and intense, with whiffs of smoke and toast from new oak barrels, but also incredible fruit concentration. Blackberries, coffee and dried spices on the palate; it finishes long and firm, with hints of licorice."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,50,"This dense wine is packed with fruit. The blackberry and anise aromas give an impression of the wine's impressive size that is confirmed on the palate. This seems sweeter than most vintages of Dow's flagship wine, but the extra sugar is balanced by big tannins. This is one single-quinta Port that doesn't seem destined for early drinking. Try in 2015."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,48,"Richly textured, verging on opulent, this should be a relatively early-maturing Port. Complex and intriguing on the nose, where smoky, minerally aromas evoke memories of sun-baked Douro schist, backed by plush blackberry fruit and a dash of maple syrup. Best from 2010."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,25,"Plummy on the nose, with the ripe aromas accented by hints of dried flowers. In the mouth, the texture is rich—almost syrupy—and the flavors head toward prune and chocolate fudge, finishing on drier, more complex notes of cocoa powder and spice. Imported by Kobrand."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,45,"This lushly fruity Port folds in enough intriguing floral aromas to be more than a simple fruit bomb. Briary notes add another element to the creamy boysenberry flavors that are incredibly rich but not cloying or syrupy. Likely to mature early but hold well, thanks to masses of supple tannins. Great quality for the price."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,91,43,"Starts off a bit floral and toasty, but the blueberry-scented fruit quickly asserts itself. Masses of soft, ripe fruit come through on the palate, along with a rich, dense, mouthfeel and soft but plentiful tannins."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,75,"Effectively a 25-year-old tawny, this wine starts off slowly, with restrained aromas of nuts and dried fruit. Then it caresses the palate with silky, lush, honeyed flavors of walnuts, oranges, cinnamon and clove, building to a crescendo on the long, anise-tinged finish."
Portugal,Baga,Red,91,60,"Luis Pato's Bairradas used to be the standouts of the D.O. In a sense they still are, although he has chosen to label them with the regional denomination of Beiras in protest over restrictive practices. In this example, Pato has harnessed the rough tannins and brash acidity of Baga into a rich creamy wine filled with blackberries and anise. It's still tannic and crisp, but it just needs another 10 years in the cellar to become fully appreciable."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,91,50,"Nutty and caramelly, this is a great example of aged tawny. Roasted walnut aromas waft from the glass, followed by flavors reminiscent of maple syrup carried across the palate on creamy-soft waves of richness."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,70,"A lighter (though not to say light), more floral style of vintage Port, with ethereal aromatics buttressed by blackberries and caramel. Finishes with bright acids and supple tannins that make it almost drinkable already. Try in 2008 and beyond."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,56,"A brooding nose of sullen blackberries and earth presages a wine that shows wonderful balance between fruit, alcohol, acidity and tannin. It's not a huge, extracted Port, but one that carries itself with grace, finishing with good length and soft tannins. Drink 2010–2030."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,90,18,"Sappy and intense on the nose, with cherries, blackberries and toast. Although some tasters used to the lush midpalates of New World wines may find this a little lacking in that department, it comes across as smooth and supple, with finely etched fruit flavors elegantly framed by oak."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,35,"Portuguese-owned Port houses, such as Barros, have long made terrific tawnies. This version is smoky and minerally, with nuts and citrus peel. It's supple and not very sweet, with a freshness and vibrancy that belie its age. Peppery on the finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,37,"A reasonably good buy in vintage Port, Silval is something of a second label for Quinta do Noval. It's less concentrated and suppler in the mouth than its sister wine, but still boasts compelling floral aromas allied to prune, berry and chocolate flavors. Worth trying a bottle before 2010."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,45,"Intentionally made in a friendly, fruit-forward style, Vau doesn't disappoint in 2000. It delivers what we've come to expect from this relatively recent creation, lush blackberry and plum flavors backed by clove and spice. If you like your Ports young and fruity, try this one soon; its longevity is untested."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,90,19,"A selection of lots not deemed worthy of inclusion in this estate's flagship red, Meandro is nevertheless a fine wine and an even better value. Smoke and herbs add complexity to the blueberries and blackberries found on the nose, while the flavors combine lush fruit with intense notes of spice and anise. Drink now–2008."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,25,"Barros's tawnies are worth seeking out. This young example shows the house's signature smoky, nutty aromas but adds more fruity scents of raisins and prunes. Supple in the mouth, with a long, toffee-filled finish."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,90,23,"Toast and vanilla notes from oak barrels are layered over aromas of cured meat and blackberries. On the palate, it's lush but not overly weighty or rich, just nicely balanced. There's plenty of spicy oak, especially on the finish, but also the fruit to support it."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,54,"This young vintage Port is quite big, with plenty of lush fruit and some herb and spice notes. It's also on the dry side for vintage Port, and it lacks the hulking tannins you might expect. Surprisingly ready to drink, even at this age."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,45,"This 20-year-old shows some surprisingly youthful notes of red fruits along with layers of caramel, honey, maple syrup and walnuts. Nicely balanced, and it comes in half-bottles too—the perfect size for smaller gatherings."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,14,"The Symington family continues to make strides in their table wine production. This is a full-bodied, smooth-textured bistro-styled red that's more of a dark purple in hue, bringing blackberry, blueberry and spice and mineral notes to the table. Enjoy it over the next year or two for its exuberant fruit. Imported by Premium Port Wines, Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,20,"With its gorgeous scents of spice cake and dates, this is a seductive LBV from the very start. It's ripe and round in the mouth, soft and lush on the finish, with a cavalcade of fig, date, chocolate and dried-spice flavors. Drink now. Imported by Premium Port Wines, Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,70,"Floral and spicy on the nose, leading into ripe blackberry and blueberry flavors. Not the richest mouthfeel or deepest flavors, but a pretty Port that finishes with crisp acidity and firm tannins. Drink 2010–2020. Imported by Signature Imports."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,89,7,"This blend of Alfrochiero, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional is a steal at the $7 price. The meaty, peppery, blackberry nose and bouncy, medium-weight palate makes this wine a ringer for a good Côtes-du-Rhône, at a fraction of the price. Even shows good length on the peppery finish. Drink now–2008. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,24,"At 10 years of age, Portal's tawny is still showing some rough edges of youth; it's big and brawny, with plump cherry-berry fruit joined by citrus and caramel. A fine café au lait note comes through on the finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,90,"Cigar smoke, molasses and dried fig aromas set the stage for a smooth, easy-drinking tawny with layers of tobacco, dried citrus and clove flavors. It's not terribly sweet or lush, but relies on delicate complexity for its appeal."
Portugal,Touriga Nacional,Red,89,27,"A big, burly wine with a firmly tannic finish, the 1999 Praemium needs a few years to shed its youthfulness. The subtle toast and vanilla notes are in proportion with the intense blackberry fruit, and it picks up some coffee notes on the finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,33,"Plums, dusty earth and dried spice mingle on the nose of this older release that actually seems more ageworthy than Portal's 1997 and 1999. It's supple, medium-weight wine, with plum, prune and spice flavors that finish with modest tannins and pleasing berry and spice notes."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,18,"You get a glimpse of the fine qualities of the 1997 vintage in this bottling, which displays lush black cherry and plum aromas and flavors against a backdrop of supple tannins and a velvety texture. The elements are well integrated, and the finish is long and fruity."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,59,"Herbal scents accent the nose of this Port, which otherwise shows pleasant plum and cocoa aromas. More plum on the palate, joined by black cherries and spice. It's lush and intense, turning a little tart on the finish. Tannins are supple and not overly prominent, even at this young age."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,30,"Boasts youthful aromas of red fruits, with just a hint of golden raisins and toffee. Strikes a fine balance between vigorous young fruit and aged notes of caramel and raisin."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,88,29,"Smoky and earthy, with intertwining notes of anise, hung game and plum. The mouthfeel is creamy and soft, the flavors oaky, especially on the finish, but amply backed by lush fruit. Drink now."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,24,"Already showing hints of brown at the rim and the beginnings of decay on the nose, this is still eminently drinkable, especially if you prefer a little age on your Port. It's supple in the mouth, with flavors of spice and brown sugar, finishing with a hint of licorice."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,19,"A very ripe style, with baked plum and prune aromas and flavors supported by hints of pastry crust and dried spices. Medium to full in body, with soft tannins and a long, spicy finish. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,12,"This is a bold, exuberantly fruity blend of 40% Touriga Franca, 40% Tinta Roriz and 20% Tinta Barroca. Mulberry and boysenberry flavors pick up hints of baked pie crust. A bit drying on the finish, but it also shows good depth of fruit. A new wine, with no track record for aging, so drink now and over the next few years. Imported by Premium Port Wines, Inc."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,88,14,"This dark purple wine opens with a trace of animale or game, but also boasts intense aromas and flavors of roasted blackberries, accented by pinches of cinnamon and clove. Broad in the mouth, it would be a solid choice to serve with grilled or roasted meats. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,25,"With its charming aromas of spice drop, ripe cherries and schistous minerality, this Taylor looks set to zoom. And it is tasty, but also a bit soft and lacking structure—something unexpected from a Port under the Taylor label. Turns chocolaty on the finish. Drink now. Imported by Kobrand."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,88,16,"This medium-bodied blend of Tinta Roriz, Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca boasts plenty of plump, juicy fruit backed by hints of cocoa and spice. The ripe cherry flavors are easy to enjoy, finishing on a fresh, mouthwatering note. Would be a great choice with grilled meats. Imported by Guardian of the Grape Imports."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,50,"Doesn't show the richness or complexity of its younger counterparts, but this effort from Ventozelo is still pretty good. Modest floral and chocolate notes and youthful grapy flavors hint at further aging potential, but the tannins are already soft. Better to err on the young side and drink it over the next several years. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,30,"Shows a lifted fruit character on the nose—maybe even a little hint of nail polish—but also some earth and berry scents. Bright raspberry flavors on the palate are backed by mineral notes, finishing crisp. Lacks the weight and structure of the best vintage Ports. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,12,"A bit understated on the nose, but what's there is nice, offering modest cherry fruit alongside dried spices and cocoa. A bit creamy in the mouth, with smooth, supple tannins, and cherry and blackberry flavors that pick up pretty spice notes on the finish. Imported by Admiral Wine Imports."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,90,80,"Densely packed aromas of tobacco, mushroom and earth yield ever-so-slowly to barnyard, mint and currant aromas. Even at nine years of age, it's tight and beneefits from some airing in a decanter. Pleasant plum and black-cherry flavors emerge with time, but the real story here is the finish, which is show-stopping: long, multifaceted and intense."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,89,22,"There's plenty of oak here, evidenced by the dominant chocolate and vanilla aromas, but there's also good fruit backing it up. Raspberries and cranberries provide a welcome counterpoint to the oak and extend through the long finish."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,87,46,"Slight cherry fruit is hanging in, but the emphasis here is on mushrooms, damp earth and forest-floor elements. The attenuated, tart cherry fruit provides a nice counterpoint to the earthy components in this mature, ready-to-drink wine."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,87,10,"Subtle smoke shadings color the predominantly blackberry and chocolate aromas before yielding to plum and black-cherry fruit flavors. Features a satiny, refined mouthfeel and finishes a bit tart. A drink-me-now quaffer that hits the right notes."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,87,15,"This Douro red speaks clearly of its origins, blending anise and mineral notes with ripe fruit. Resin and spice notes add interest to the black cherry flavors, backed by just a hint of toasty oak. Structured and firm, this wine could use a bit more lushness and flesh, but nicely conveys its sense of place. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,86,14,"Shows some of the weakness of the vintage in its rather tart profile and flavors of red fruits and cranberries. A good effort, just short of the usual standard at this estate."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,20,"Less lush and welcoming than the other LBVs reviewed for this issue, C. da Silva's Presidential brand instead shows more acidity and tannin. The result is a crisp, pepper- and plum-flavored Port with a slight rancio quality. Imported by Jack Poust & Co., Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,95,154,"A superb wine, elegance and weight combined magisterially. It has all the right mature flavors, ripe fruit, intense marmalade and concentration. This is a wine with a great reputation, and the taste doesn't let that reputation down. Imported by Kobrand."
Portugal,Port,Red,94,70,"Always one of the best 20-year-olds, and this is no exception. The secret is in the velvet-like smoothness, which combines with a balanced mix of fig and caramel flavors, just a touch of burnt vanilla and the sort of acidity that makes you want another glass. Delicious."
Portugal,Port,Red,94,98,"A superbly dense, concentrated wine so rich in flavor that it almost has a brooding, dark quality. The hint of medicinal character just gives all this intensity a lift, and goes with flavors of roasted nuts and licorice. The aftertaste has just the right acidity. Imported by Premium Port Wines, Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,94,125,"This is a sweet but deliciously mature wine that exudes the richness of its burnt orange flavors, layers of sweet toffee, and clean, hugely rich aftertaste. A great wine. Imported by William Grant & Sons, Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,94,152,"An old, mature wine, but one that has kept its ripeness and richness. The concentration is so intense that one glass is almost enough (except it tastes so good). There are walnuts, bitter chocolate and a delicious clean aftertaste. Imported by Premium Port Wines, Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,44,"As so often, Niepoort comes through with a fabulous wine. It is dry and structured, with mature flavors that suggest there are wines in the blend that are older than 10 years. There is a bitter chocolate character, intense bitter almonds and finishing freshness and acidity. The whole comes in a concentrated, intense package."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,135,"At first taste, this appears amazingly fresh for a 40-year-old, but then the older flavors kick in. There is concentration, ripeness and huge intensity of flavor. It's a beautiful wine, with dried apricots giving freshness. Imported by Pernod Ricard."
Portugal,Port,Red,93,148,"A dark, concentrated wine, very impressive. But with all this concentration, there is also sweet fruit, flavors of apricots that have been bottled in spirits. This is a lovely wine, with just a hint of mature, medicinal character. Imported by Premium Port Wines, Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,52,"Another Port success from the Branco family of Quinta do Portal, following their success with the 2003 vintage. This is a lovely, lively wine, with fresh acidity alongside good, mature fruit. It is ripe but very elegant, with a sweet, dried fruit aftertaste."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,31,"Powered with acidity and its firm structure, this is an intensely dry, concentrated, powerful wine. It certainly has wines in the blend that are older than 10 years, yet it is definitely a 10-Year Oldin style, as the fresh fruit to finish confirms."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,42,"This is an impressive wine, all power and concentration. Flavors of bitter chocolate and arabica coffee are balanced with citrusy freshness. It's relatively lively and vibrant, but there are also plenty of mature flavors."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,56,"Although part of Barros, Kopke still operates relatively independently, and obviously can draw on good stocks of aged tawnys. This wine certainly tastes all of 20 years, with its richness and dryness finely in balance, and with lemon jelly and intense ripe fruits shining through."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,40,"At first sip, this seems gentle and soft. But behind this smooth, glossy exterior, there are delicious flavors waiting to emerge. With caramel, oranges, acidity and a twist of treacle, this becomes a fine, balanced wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,92,174,"This impressively concentrated wine has classic burnt caramel aromas, with dense, fig and bitter chocolate flavors. It is rich, delicious and tastes somewhat older than its 30-year label."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,50,"This is a sweet, dense wine, balancing lively dried fruit flavors against intense coffee and treacle. It has great style, a powerful wine that manages to present a softer side."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,30,"This is a great, fresh, young style of wine, with figs and bitter marmalade flavors. There's a touch of orange peel, a hint of vanilla and very ripe, delicious fruit."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,75,"From its vineyard in the hot Torto Valley, Ramos-Pinto has produced a rich, densely sweet, lightly burnt wine. It's deliciously attractive, very smooth and flavored with perfumed dried apricots."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,25,"This recent launch from Warre's is delicious. It's a fruity tawny, with delicious acidity and touches of bitter orange and chocolate. Classically balanced and fresh."
Portugal,Port,Red,91,28,"The legendary Noval has produced a deliciously attractive, light and poised wine, with fresh fruit and acidity. It is dry in style, with some tannins, and a layer of spirit that is well in balance. The aftertaste floats with acidity and fruit."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,98,"An impressively concentrated wine from this firm owned by Barros. There's a dark toffee flavor that runs parallel to fine acidity throughout. The aftertaste is fresh, but still full of concentration."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,85,6,"From a sun-baked region in the south, and this wine does show some of that heat in its slightly stewed fruit aromas and flavors. But there's also decent concentration, some pleasant strawberry and black pepper notes and a juicy, mouthwatering finish. Drink now. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,24,"An attractively dry style of wine, with a concentrated inner core of firm acid and lightly burnt flavors. It has intensity, along with good fruitiness. This lesser brand of the Symington group is worth seeking out, both for its quality and for its good value."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,53,"Although this famous name has produced quite a light 20-year-old, that lightness is more than made up for by the beautiful, smooth flavors, the taste of lemon jelly, dried apricots and peaches, and fine, fresh acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,30,"A hugely rich, sweet wine, full of concentration and very ripe fruit flavors. This is the classic Fonseca style, all richness and depth of flavor. There's power here, but it is all clothed in acidity and great fruits."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,52,"This is a hugely dry, burnt style, very concentrated. The licorice and bitter coffee flavors are dense, layered and well balanced with the acidity. A serious wine that demands attention."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,108,"This is a finely balanced, rich but elegant wine, from a company owned by Sogrape, Portugal's largest wine producer. There is some good burnt caramel flavor, as well as ripe fruit, and a delicious, just lightly fresh aftertaste."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,42,"Warre's seems to have found just the right formula for its tawnys. The 10-Year OldOtima is a fine wine, and so is this Otima 20. It has aromas of almonds, layers of acidity and sweetness, the flavor of bitter oranges, and a round, ripe aftertaste."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,50,"A dense, concentrated, but deliciously clean wine, with balanced fruit, marmalade flavor and a touch of spirit to finish. This is a wine that shows considerable character and style."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,26,"From property owned by the Kopke and Van Zeller families (Fernando van Zeller is Baron de Vilar), this classically attractive 10-year style has deep gold/brown color and is ripe and almost sweet (but with just enough dryness). It also has freshness, young fruit flavors and just a hint of an attractive, burnt character. To find a fine example of a 10-year-old, look no further."
Portugal,Tinta Roriz,Red,85,16,"A bit of a disappointment from this winery, but the flavors here seem a touch overripe, with pruny notes intruding into the blackberries. Obvious American oak marks the nose with herbal, dill-like notes and the finish with dry, woody tannins and caramel flavors. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,85,12,"An interesting wine—one that combines a certain sour, resinous quality with hints of sur-maturité. Add leather, clove and cinnamon and the result is a reasonably complex wine for a reasonable price. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,29,"A wine that is in the fresh, sweet style of 10-year-old, while balancing chocolate, cocoa and dark fig flavors. A firm structure keeps  this profusion of flavors in order."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,28,"Another Symington family brand that often shows well, Smith Woodhouse's 10-Year Oldis big and firm, quite tannic even, and very rich and dry. This is a good, solid, powerful wine, with great finishing acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,29,"While it is quite dark in color, this wine still has plenty of good, 10-Year Oldfresh fruit flavors. Perfumed and delicate, it has light sweetness and a good layer of fruit and wood acidity, leaving a dry aftertaste. Its quality is an indication of the impressive improvements that have occurred at Royal Oporto in recent years."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,60,"There is plenty going on in Noval's 20-year-old. It is a dry style, but the generous fruit combines marmalade and fresh citrus flavors, along with powerful ripeness. Acidity is there too, giving a lift at the end."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,35,"More in the elegant style, this Delaforce wine shows plenty of ripe flavors, but then restrains them. It is very pure, a delightful wine that is very drinkable."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,150,"Dry, with some burnt character, this 40-year old from one of the companies owned by Barros also has great sweet fruit, lime marmalade and layers of acidity. It's well in balance, leaving acidity to finish. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports."
Portugal,Red Blend,Red,84,7,"Slightly stewed or baked, but there's enough plum and herb complexity to keep it interesting. Soft and low in acid; supple and easy to drink over the next few months. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,41,"This wine comes from a wildly remote vineyard high in the Upper Douro. It is a fine, balanced wine, packed with acidity to balance the sweetness. It's relatively soft and gentle, with good, fresh flavors of figs."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,60,"This is dry, with burnt aromas. The palate is very concentrated, packed with bitter fruits and hints of lemon. A sipping Port, just ready for contemplation."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,30,"Great ripe fruits dominate this young, fresh wine. There is balancing sweetness and delicate, lightly burnt acidity. Now under the same management as Taylor and Fonseca, Croft is a name that should be as well known for Port as for Sherry."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,100,"While this wine certainly tastes old, it has a delicious golden glow from the richness of the apricot jelly-flavored ripe fruit. There is just a touch of spirit, but this adds to the warmth. Imported by Jack Poust & Co., Inc."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,50,A fresh delicate wine. It has a fine array of orange flavors and a light touch of acidity and caramel.
Portugal,Port,Red,89,51,"A big, sweet, soft wine, with lively fruit, some bitter coffee and sweet treacle flavors. This is an elegant, attractive wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,89,48,"A smooth, ripe, caramel- and toffee-flavored wine, with sweet fruit. Tastes young for a 20-year old, this still has good structure and is well integrated."
Portugal,Castelão,Red,84,10,"Starts with pleasant notes of black cherries,  leather, and a hint of game, but also features a slightly drying, stalky note that shortens the finish. Tasted twice, with consistent notes. Imported by Signature Imports."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,23,"Very soft, but with good concentration, this bitter orange flavored wine has ripeness, but also acidity, finishing with some bitter chocolate flavors. Attractively balanced."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,128,"An intensely sweet wine, with mature fruit that shows some richness and orange marmalade flavors. It is spoiled by a hint of volatility, which leaves a sharp aftertaste. Imported by Admiral Imports."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,157,"A very sweet rich wine, in the Fonseca house style. But it lacks the intensity, going more for sweet almonds, along with some bitter marmalade, and a young taste. Imported by Kobrand."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,22,"Barros is not well known outside Portugal, but this wine suggests it should be. Delicate and perfumed, this has a fine balance that leaves a fresh, fruity aftertaste. There is structure, sweetness and ripeness."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,84,17,"This medium-bodied red features decent balance between tannins, alcohol and acids, but the flavors are just a little different. There are some cherry flavors, maybe even black cherry, but also herbal, chlorophyllic notes that start on the nose and persist through the finish. Imported by Carpathian Imports LLC."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,115,"Apart from the fact that this tastes too fresh to be a 30-year-old, this is a delicious wine, with ripe, sweet fruits, caramel and just the right layer of dryness."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,40,"Layers of dried fruits and prunes give a fruity character to this gently sweet wine. It's very elegant and delicate, but certainly very drinkable."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,39,"Santa Eufemia is a new name on the U.S. market, from a vineyard in the Baixo Corgo, the western end of the Port vineyards. This is a mature 10-year-old, light in color and dry, with coffee and cocoa flavors. There is a delicious, lightly acidic, long-lasting aftertaste."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,25,"A clean, very poised style, with attractive acidity and good balance. It's just as deliciously fresh as a 10-Year Oldshould be."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,83,9,"The understated fruit in this light, lean wine has a character reminiscent of tart berries and sour cherries, framed by balsa wood. Turns lemony and dry on the finish. The crisp acids make it best with fatty meat dishes."
Portugal,Port,Red,88,28,"A firm style of wine, from the oldest Port producer. With tannins and bitter almond and chocolate flavors, this is certainly on the drier side."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,122,"A fine, sweet, fresh wine, which tastes younger than 30 years. The flavors are ripe, layering milk chocolate with acidity in good balance."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,30,"This is a very easy, light and fresh style, with sweet caramel flavors balanced by sweet figs and milk chocolate. It finishes  clean, with just a touch of acidity."
Portugal,Portuguese Red,Red,82,9,"Despite containing only a small percentage of Cabvernet Sauvignon, the herbal—almost vegetal—scent of unripe Cabernet dominates this wine. It's plump and round in the mouth, yet has a distinctly unripe character to it. If you can, track down the 2001 instead—it's much better. Imported by Admiral Wine Imports."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,30,"Ripe and fresh. There are touches of bitter oranges, lemon peel and ginger. The aftertaste is soft and sweet."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,48,"A delicious, easy wine that floats by with orange marmalade and fresh acidity. Marred on the finish by some volatility."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,50,"If it wasn't for the unbalanced spirity element to this wine, it would rate higher. The concentration and the dried fruit and lemon jelly flavors are attractive. But that spirit comes through at the finish."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,80,"A dense, firm style of wine from this small Dutch-owned Port house. Offers good acidity, old wood and very bitter chocolate flavors. The aftertaste, by contrast, is sweet."
Portugal,Port,Red,87,50,"A generally balanced sweet wine, with layers of candied fruits, and sweet marmalade flavors. The ripeness and the sweetness are spoiled by the volatility that shows in the finishing acidity."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,85,"An attractive, relatively simple wine with dense chocolate flavors and some good, concentrated fruit."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,20,"This independent company has a reputation for its aged tawnies. This 10-Year Oldis in the sweet style, but it has a fine freshness, as well as flavors of figs and firm, structured fruit at its core."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,28,"With French winemaker Jean-Hugues Gros (who used to work in Burgundy with Jacques Prieur) in charge, Heredias  is producing both table wines and Ports. This 10-Year Oldis sweet, fresh, with caramel flavors, leavened with fresh acidity in the aftertaste."
Portugal,Port,Red,86,26,"A very sweet style, with flavors of Hershey bars, figs, vanilla and caramel. Rather out of balance."

Portugal,Port,Red,85,42,"A well-balanced, simple wine, with pleasant rich fruit and refreshing acidity. This tastes younger than a 20-year-old, but is still attractive enough."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,22,"A very soft, easy wine, with some good concentration that just lacks a central core."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,46,"This is a huge, concentrated, dry wine, which is left very unbalanced by the burnt character and the dominance of the spirit. tThe acid ity, at least, leaves freshness."
Portugal,Port,Red,85,50,"It is the harshness, with unbalanced spirit, that mars what is otherwise a mature, dry style with good burned caramel flavors."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,60,"This is more like an Italian bitters than a Port, with its roasted coffee aromas, and bitter flavors. Almost medicinal."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,50,"An easy, fresh, ripe style, with dried fruits and a perfume note that is spoiled  by the rubber character and some old wood. Anybody who stays in Portugal's pousadas, the state-run hotels, will have had this brand."
Portugal,Port,Red,84,130,"This is a very old 40-year old, with some harsh, burnt and rubber flavors. There's high acidity and caramel toffee, masking the mature fruit. Imported by HGC Imports."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,42,"A powerful, solid wine, packed with luscious fruit. The perfumes and the ripeness of the fruit are currently covered with a firm tannin layer, but this should develop well as a medium-term wine."
Portugal,Port,Red,90,50,"This wine has the dark fruit typical of this quinta, but this year shows more elegance than usual, with dusty tannins and concentrated, sweet fruit."
